This was  years ago when my son was starting middle school. I was transporting him  and a group of his new friends. One of the friends was French, and  spoke French at home. My son mentioned that I had taken French in high  school, and so one of his friends asked me to say something in French  and see if French girl could understand me.

Before  I go on, a note on parenting style: we joke around with our kids all  the time. I know that not all parents joke with their children; some of  my kids' friends enjoyed to a dad who makes a joke, and some would look  at me like I grew a second head.

So I said to the French girl, «quelque chose». Immediately the friends turned to French girl and asked ""What did he say?""

I waited, wondering whether she would join my joke.

A  sly smile crept across her face as she said, ""he said...something"". The  rest of the trip, the friends tried to convince her to reveal what it  was that I had said. «quelque chose» is the French phrase for  ""something"".",1609112232

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling.""

So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth...the Fifth..."" Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery:

91,kcbtyf,dadjokes,plasticrockingchair,So an english woman and a black woman got into a fight at a Victoria's Secret.,"Officer Riley was used to being tasked to cases like these. In fact, he got assigned to these cases so much that he had gotten pretty good at resolving these situations in a way where everyone left happy, but Riley found these cases really boring. Still, he finished his doughnut, took a sip of his coffee, and began to make his way to the store.

He got to the store pretty quickly. The cop cars outside let him know he was in the right place. As he pulled up, he made eye contact with Officer Patrick, and he promptly got out of his car to meet him. After a quick greeting Patrick began to explain the situation. ""An english woman and a black woman got into a fight but the women involved are either too distraught or angry to talk to us,"" Officer Patrick explained. He didn't need to say anything more. Riley looked towards the entrance of the Victoria's Secret and immediately saw the two ladies in question. One of them was sitting on the sidewalk holding her head, and a few feet away from her was the other woman still very clearly upset.

Riley decided that the woman on the sidewalk needed his help first as he was confident she lost the fight. He approached her and introduced himself and told her that he needed to know what happened. After some poking and proding she finally began to talk. ""I was just talking on the phone and that lady over just came up to me and started screaming at the top of her lungs,"" the english woman said. ""Surely there was more to it than that,""  Riley said, ""Can you recall saying anything on the phone that may have set her off?"" She swore up and down that she was just having a regular conversation with a friend, and she didn't say anything that could've offended anyone.

Now that he got one side of the story it was time to talk to the other woman. Riley made his way past the officers trying to calm her down, and introduced himself as he did with the english woman. Luckily the other officers seemed to have calmed down a bit since he got there. She admitted to beating up the other woman with just a single ask, but now he needed to know why. ""Why'd you do it?"" Riley asked.

""That bitch is racist!"" the black woman said. ""She was walking into the Victoria's Secret and I heard her say that she needed to buy some knickers!""",1607871123

He said, ""Look at my hair. It used to be so magnificent, but it's completely gone now. My hair can't be saved. But look outside at the forest. It's such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they'll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair.""

""What I want you to do..."" the man continued. ""Is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong.""

So they did.

Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.

I asked him what kind of a bird it was and he told me it’s a rare almost extinct species called a Foux (pronounced Foo). This foux was the apple of his eye and he would take care of the bird as if it was his own child.
Sometime during this period the Foux began developing a real bad case of constipation and my father was really worried about it. He tried all kinds if medicines to make the Foux pass it’s bowels, but nothing was working.
One day, during this period, I woke up to a huge argument taking place between my parents. My mom was accusing him of cheating on her during one of his tours, she had found some pictures of him and another woman and he was denying it vehemently. I realized then that my father had been quite the philanderer and this wasn’t the first time he had been caught. My mom was trying to get him to just admit to his indiscretion.

“Why don’t you just admit it Harry”, she said; 

but he stuck to his denial, 

“You think I could ever do something like this Sarah”, he said. 

Right then amidst all this ruckus, the Foux began to take a dump, in the middle of the living room.

My mom looked at the bird, then looked back at my dad and with a sense of resignation she just said “Well if the Foux shits...”",1607004329

""Talking Dog for Sale.""

He rings the bell and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard. The guy goes into the backyard and sees a black mutt just sitting there.

""You talk?"" he asks.

""Yep,"" the mutt replies.

""So, what's your story?""

The mutt looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered my gift of talking pretty young and I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA about my gift, and in no time they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies eight years running. The jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger and I wanted to settle down. So I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals. Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.""

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.

The owner says, ""Ten dollars.""

The guy says, ""This dog is amazing. Why on earth are you selling him, so cheap?""

88,jyk00c,dadjokes,Pensrule2007,Prom night,"It was time for the prom at Klondike High School and Tim's friends were desperately trying to convince him to go. He considered it, but was very self-conscious of the fact that he had had an accident as a young child that caused him to lose his eye, and the best his family could afford was to buy him a wooden eye. After several days of goading, Tim finally decides to go. 

Sally was in a similar situation. Her friends desperately wanted her to go prom with them, but she was recently in a car accident and lost her right leg. She had a prosthetic, but it was very uncomfortable, so she had a hard time walking. Reluctantly, she agreed to go. 

It was the night of the prom and both Tim and Sally were getting all gussied up with their friends. They both make it to the prom, but when they arrive, they are both too nervous to dance. Tim's friends notice Sally sitting on the wall and say to him, ""Look over there! There's a cute girl who's all alone and needs a partner to dance with. Why don't you go over there and ask her to dance?"" After some further convincing, Tim sheepishly begins to walk over to Sally to ask her. As he approaches her, he getes nervous, and awkwardly stands in front of her for a few seconds before saying, ""Wuh...wuh...would you like to dance with me?""

Excitedly, Sally exclaims, ""Would I? Would I?""

The last shoes we ever played were on our world tour. We played the Americas and then flew over to Europe. We played our way through Russia and even a couple of gigs in China, before selling out our final show in Japan.

I made a few friends at work, and grew close with one in particular, Narada-san.
One day Narada had the day off for a funeral, but that wasn't enough; he needed more time. He was torn between his obligation to return to work and his desire to have more time at home. He asked me what he should do.

Desperate, he throws the cough syrup as the casket!

And…

The coffin stops….",1605739752

However, the thief was not your ordinary thief. He only stole bells. Any kind of bell, whether a tiny bell from a kitten’s collar, all the way up to the bell from the king’s royal bell tower. 

When the king awoke one morning, the bell tower’s bell was missing. The king, being brave and noble, decided to follow the thief back to his lair. He chose four of his most loyal soldiers, mounted his horse, and rode off into the snowy woods, following the footprints left behind on the ground. 

Soon, he and his soldiers arrived to a clearing in the woods. In front of them was a large, bell-shaped building. They found the thief’s lair!Pointing to the recent tracks left in the snow by the thief, the king announced to the soldiers,

Way over right field, too high for anyone to reach, and it always landed in exactly the 17th row of the stands, give or take a couple feet. 

He earned the nickname “the machine” for how consistently he hit the exact same spot every time. Right field, 17th row, every single time. He did this for 20 years before he retired. Tickets to the 2-3 seats that the ball always landed on sold for over $2k a pop by the time he retired because you were guaranteed at least a couple home run balls. 

And the day he retired a reporter asked him “How does it feel to be retiring as the greatest hitter of all time?”

Hugh just looked at the reporter puzzled. “What do you mean?” He said. 

The reporter clarified “literally over 5,000 times you went to the plate and hit a home run to right field, 17th row of the stands!”

Hugh looked dejected and disappointed “yeah, my greatest failure...”

“What do you mean?” Said the reporter incredulously.

So this guy has been drinking with his buddies all night and he's as drunk as a skunk, gets home, falls up the stairs, undresses and goes to bed next to his wife. He falls asleep and next thing he knows, *bang*, he dies and finds himself waiting at the pearly gates.

The guy refuses to believe this is happening, he says to St. Peter: ""This can't be possible, I'm a healthy man! This is not the way I die. You have to let me return down there!""  
The guy can see St. Peter looks like he's feeling sorry for him, but he tells him that unfortunately, there's no policy for allowing people back on Earth. The guy insists: ""But come on, there's got to be something you can do! I'll put up with anything, really, as long as you let me go back down.""  
So St. Peters tells him: ""Well really, there's just this one possibility: you can go back, but only as a hen. That's the only thing we can allow."" The guy guesses that this really is his only chance, so he agrees reluctantly.  
So he's back on Earth in this beautiful chicken coop, the sun is shining, there's green grass everywhere, this is hen paradise. The other hens greet him with delight and he tells them his story, everything goes nicely. But then he feels kind of unwell, there's something wrong with his stomach. He asks this old hen: ""Tell me, I've got this weird feeling in my belly, I'm not too well. What is happening to me?""

The old hen: ""Well dearie, we hens lay eggs, you know. I bet you've never laid a nice egg before... You need to push it out now, and you'll feel much better after!""  
So the guy pushes and pushes, and *wham*, out pops his first egg. The old hen congratulates him and he feels much better. But not 5 minutes later, his pain comes back. He returns to the old hen for advice.

""Well dearie, it's quite special but it happens that you need to lay TWO eggs, so go back there and keep pushing!""   
So he goes back to his nest and pushes, and nothing comes, and he pushes harder, and *wham*, out comes his second egg! He feels much better, but not 2 minutes later, you guessed it, he's back in terrible pain and goes to see the old hen.

""What's this bullshit here, and don't tell me I've got a third egg to lay!"" The old hen can't make head or tail of it and just tells him that when in doubt, he should be pushing. So the guy goes back to work and then, *wham*, his wife wakes him up with this smashing slap in the face and yells: ""*Dave! Dave wake up you’re fucking shitting the bed again!!!""",1605211946
