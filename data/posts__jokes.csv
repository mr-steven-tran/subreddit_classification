To make matters worms, they couldn‚Äôt dig their way under the river. Maggie wanted to turn around, but Magnus said there was a bridge nearby, and insisted a bridge isn‚Äôt a dime a dozen, and it was completely free, so in the end, it was only a blessing in disguise that they missed the boat. So they crawled along the river until they came to the bridge. 

Magnus was the best of both worms when it came to wriggling fast, so he went first.  
‚ÄúFingers crossed! Break a leg!‚Äù shouted Maggie encouragingly after him.  
Magnus turned and shouted back, ‚ÄúGet your act together, I don‚Äôt have any of those!‚Äù  

(I won‚Äôt beat around the bush, Maggie‚Äôs an idiot when it comes to idioms, but I‚Äôd let her off the hook. My poor uncle was never let off the hook, and to make a long worm short, he drowned.)  

Anyway, as Magnus wriggled his way over the bridge, he was run over by a car.  
‚ÄúHang in there!‚Äù Maggie shouted, and hurried to see if he had bit the dust, or just been bent out of shape. 
As it turned out, the car had only run over the tip of Magnus‚Äô tail, and made him shit his pant.  
‚ÄúThings almost got out of hand there,‚Äù he admitted to Maggie, ‚Äúbut no pain no gain, and I‚Äôm glad I got that out of my system, I‚Äôve been constipated for a week!‚Äù  
‚ÄúWell, pull yourself together, easy does it, but this is neither the time nor place to hit the sack.‚Äù  

Shortly after, Magnus was run over again, and Maggie didn‚Äôt need to pull his leg to know he had perished.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the last straw!‚Äù Maggie exclaimed. ‚ÄúI knew we shouldn‚Äôt have crossed this bridge when we came to it!‚Äù

After several miscarriages and countless nights of trying to conceive, the wife finally got pregnant and had a beautiful baby boy 9 months later. The father vowed on that day to do anything possible to make sure his son lived a happy life.
On his son's 5th birthday, the father went up to him and said,
""Son, happy birthday, I want you to be happy so I'm going to take you to the mall and you can pick out ANYTHING you want and I will buy it for you on the spot.""
The son replied,
""No thanks dad, what I really want is one red rubber ball""
The father was confused, but his son really seemed to want the ball, so he didn't question and purchased him the ball.
When his son was sixteen and got his license, the father went up to him once again and said,
""Son, I'm so proud of you that I'm going to drive you to the car lot, and you can pick out ANY car that you want, and I will buy if for you on the spot""
The son replied,
""No thanks dad, what I really want is a box of one hundred red rubber balls""
Once again the father was confused, but he had vowed to keep his son happy, and he purchased a box of 100 red rubber balls.
Several years later, when the son graduated college, his father went to him and said,
""I'm very proud of you son, I'm going to give you $100,000 to get you started on your post-education life""
The son replied,
""No thanks dad, what I really want is a box of one thousand red rubber balls""
The father was puzzled once more, but again, decided not to push and rather purchased the box of red rubber balls.
Ten years later, the son had his wedding, marrying a beautiful woman whom he loved very much. The father went up his son at the reception and said,
""Son, I'm so proud of you, I'm going to buy you a house worth 2 million dollars for you and your wife to live in""
The son replied,
""No thanks dad, what I really want is a box of 1 million red rubber balls""
The father was dumbfounded, but decided his son's wishes were best and purchased him the box of balls without question.
A few years later, the son became terminally ill. He was put in the hospital, hooked up to what seemed like thousands of tubes and machines, and could barely speak. The father was heartbroken, but satisfied that his son had accomplished so much in such a short life.
In the hospital, the father went by his son's bedside and said,
""Son, you've been such a wonderful person in your life, I'm proud to be your father. I just have on question, why is it that when I offered you all those things, all you asked for were red rubber balls?""

kmp2s4,Jokes,ChaoticGoodWhatsIts,The Afterlife,"A businessman dies and finds himself in The Afterlife. To his surprise, it‚Äôs not at all like he‚Äôd heard. Every single religion was wrong.

The walls smell like mildew, it‚Äôs dark, and the air is moist and pungent.

Suddenly, he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and sees a homeless man he‚Äôd passed almost every day on his walk between the train station and his office building.

‚ÄúHoly crap! What are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI died, too,‚Äù explains the homeless man. ‚ÄúI woke up a few days ago and found myself here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, at least there‚Äôs a familiar face. What is this place?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis crap hole is the lowest level of The Afterlife,‚Äù says the homeless man. ‚ÄúYou must‚Äôve done something pretty terrible to end up down here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I was waiting to cross the road and this insufferable hipster was standing next to me ‚Äî‚Äú

Just then, a gong sounded three times: BONG! BONG! BONG!

The businessman watched as everyone around them slowly assembled into three separate lines, grimacing and eye-rolling all the way.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this all about?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou arrived just in time for dinner.‚Äù The homeless man gestured to the three lines. ‚ÄúThat line over there is for a half-eaten, moldy hot dog bun. The middle line is for bland creamed corn that they drop on the floor right before serving it. The last line is putrid sewer water with floating bits of god-knows-what.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh,‚Äù groans the businessman. They shuffle through each line, find a couple ass-numbing, uneven rock stools and choke down their food.

As they‚Äôre eating, the homeless man educates the businessman about The Afterlife.

‚ÄúIt turns out there‚Äôs four levels. We, of course, are in the lowest level.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it possible to get to the next level?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù replies the homeless man, lowering his voice. He gestures behind him. ‚ÄúSee that guard next to that door? He can be bribed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWoah! How much?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe wants $1,000.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I ain‚Äôt got shit else to do,‚Äù says the businessman.

He secures a job and, after about a year, raises $1,000.

He walks up to the guard, opens his coat, and shows the stack of bills to the guard. The guard looks around, pockets the money, and opens a door to the third level of The Afterlife. The businessman slips through, and the door slams shut.

He looks around. He finds himself in a studio apartment. The walls are cracked and stained, the shag carpet hasn‚Äôt been vacuumed in years, several lights are burned out, but it ain‚Äôt a dungeon.

He descends a few flights of stairs and heads out to a small, overgrown courtyard bordered by neglected shrubs. The sky is overcast. People are milling about; a handful are trying to play basketball with an under-inflated ball and looking rather disappointed, but making the best of it.

He feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and sees the homeless man grinning up at him!

‚ÄúOh man, you‚Äôre here, too!‚Äù

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù replies the homeless man. ‚ÄúGot here about a week ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm glad to see a familiar face,‚Äù the businessman says as a stray dog pees on a broken street lamp a few feet away.

‚ÄúSo, we never finished our conversation last year,‚Äù recalled the homeless man. ‚ÄúWhat did you do that you ended up in the lowest level of The Afterlife?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I was waiting to cross the road and this insufferable hipster was standing next to me, talking loudly into his phone, and a bus was driving down the street towards us‚Äî‚Äú

Again, a loud gong sounded: **BONG! BONG! BONG!**

And again, people slowly organized themselves into three lines.

‚ÄúLunchtime?‚Äù inquired the businessman.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù The homeless man gestured to the three lines. ‚ÄúIn that line, you get a hamburger with the consistency of a hockey puck and a stale bun. In the second line, a handful of broken potato chips. And in the third line, flat Coke.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs better than the crap in the last level.‚Äù

The men both make their way through the lines and find a wet picnic table. As they sit and their pants slowly take in the dampness, the businessman inevitably asks:

‚ÄúSo, there‚Äôs gotta be a way to get to Level 2, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù the homeless man talks in a hushed tone. ‚ÄúSee that guard behind me?‚Äù

He gestures. The businessman sees a guard standing next to the door of a rusted-out porta-potty.

‚ÄúYeah. How much?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo hundred thousand.‚Äù

The businessman nearly spits out his charred burger. He wipes his mouth and shrugs.

‚ÄúWell, I ain‚Äôt got shit else to do.‚Äù

He takes a job and, after ten years, raises $200,000.

He wanders over to the guard at the shit house. He unzips a duffel bag and opens it. The guard looks down into the duffel, zips it back up, slings it over his shoulder, and turns his back on the businessman.

The businessman opens the door of the porta-potty and walks in.

To his amazement, a lavish home opens up before his eyes. There‚Äôs a polished grand piano sitting in the corner of a room filled with books. Another room has a brand new billiards table with shiny balls, lined up and ready for a game. Hunting trophies adorn the walls.

He wanders through the home, opens a pair of French doors, and finds himself on a veranda overlooking a courtyard. Several people are laughing and enjoying a game of beach volleyball.

He feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and, once again, finds the homeless man smiling up at him.

‚ÄúOh man, I‚Äôm so glad to see you!‚Äù

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù replied the homeless man. ‚ÄúHere we are again! I got here a few months ago.‚Äù

They catch up, having a great time and laughing.

There‚Äôs a lull in the conversation. The homeless man, once again, breaks the silence:

‚ÄúWe never finished our conversation 11 years ago. What did you do that you ended up on the lowest level of The Afterlife?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I was waiting to cross the road and this insufferable hipster was standing next to me, talking loudly into his phone, and a bus was driving down the street towards us, so I put my hand in the hipster‚Äôs shoulder and ‚Äî‚Äú

**BONG! BONG! BONG!**

Once again, people began organizing themselves into three lines.

‚ÄúThe food here has *gotta* be great!‚Äù The businessman looked eager for some food.

‚ÄúOh, you know it!‚Äù The homeless man gestured to the first line: ‚ÄúThat line is for barbecue pulled pork. Any kind of barbecue sauce you want, they have. The second line is for cole slaw, potato salad, and a slice of any kind of pie you can think of. The third line has every microbrew in existence!‚Äù

They load up their plates, find two large leather chairs and sit down. They‚Äôre having a great time when the businessman‚Äôs curiosity gets the better of him.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs *gotta* be a way to the top level of The Afterlife, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù replies the homeless man in a hushed tone. He gestures over his shoulder. ‚ÄúSee that guy at the door to the cabana? Ten million dollars and you‚Äôre in.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoly shit!‚Äù He nearly chokes on a piece of Kentucky-bourbon barbecue pork. ‚ÄúWell, I ain‚Äôt got shit else to do.‚Äù

The businessman takes a job and, after 100 years, secures ten million dollars.

He walks up to the guard at the cabana. He cracks open a metal suitcase, revealing stacks upon stacks of bills. The guard looks around, closes the suitcase, picks it up, and wanders away from the cabana.

The businessman walks through the cabana door.

The doors squeak shut as the businessman is blinded by brilliant gold light.

As his eyes adjust, his breath is taken away. A chorus of cherubs heralds his arrival with an epic symphony, moving him to tears.

Marble pillars tower above him. Light shines down from three bright suns, casting rays through glorious, intricate stained glass windows. Elaborate fountains punctuate the crystal-clear waterways bordering every single mirrored walking path. Gorgeous, scantily-dressed women offer him intricate hors d‚Äôoeuvres and glasses of champagne at every bend in the pathway.

He feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and, sure enough, the homeless man is beaming at him.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it!‚Äù exclaims the businessman, who tightly hugs the homeless man. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the top level of The Afterlife!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fantastic, isn‚Äôt it? I got here a few months before you. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined this!‚Äù

They walk on and catch up, laughing and enjoying themselves.

Eventually, the homeless man asks again: ‚ÄúWe never finished the conversation we started 111 years ago. How did you end up in the lowest level of The Afterlife?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I was waiting to cross the road and this insufferable hipster was standing next to me, talking loudly into his phone, and a bus was driving down the street towards us, so I put my hand in the hipster‚Äôs shoulder, waited for the bus to get closer, and ‚Äî‚Äú

**BONG! BONG! BONG!**

Once again, the inhabitants lined themselves up into three lines.

‚ÄúHoly shit, get a load of this,‚Äù starts the homeless man. ‚ÄúThe first line is bacon-wrapped filet mignon medallions cooked any way you want. The second line is garlic-butter mashed red potatoes. And the *third* line...‚Äù The homeless man trails off, the smile fades from his face, and suddenly seems lost in thought.

‚ÄúWhat? *What?* What‚Äôs in the third line?!‚Äù The businessman begs for an explanation.

The homeless man looks down at the ground. Under his breath, he says, ‚ÄúI gotta know. I *just* gotta know.‚Äù He slowly turns to the business man, puts his hand on his arm, and asks, ‚ÄúAfter 111 years and one million, two hundred and one thousand dollars: would you have come all this way if you‚Äôd known there was no punchline?‚Äù",1609282560

kmhilh,Jokes,johanll,"Once upon a time, in a magical world, there lived a snake named Nate.","In this land, actually rather close to Nate‚Äôs house, there was a great road, and next to this road was an enormous lever. The lever was ancient, and the myth around the lever was that if you were to push it,  it would trigger the end of the world. One day, Nate was slithering along the road. When he came upon the lever, he began crossing the road so he could get a look at it. At the same moment, a truck came zooming around the corner at 70 mph, and the driver found himself in a dilemma: either hit the snake and run him over, or swerve, hit the lever, and end the world. 

Needless to say, the driver ran over poor Nate and went on his merry way.

What‚Äôs the moral of this story? Better Nate than lever.",1609259267

Saint Peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let this poor soul in.

kmbjn7,Jokes,Shagzter,Trucker is hauling a B-double with three containers full of computer parts.," It's getting on toward dark, and so he stops at a steakhouse for a bite.


The first thing he sees is a sign on the door: 


NO THONGS 


NO SINGLETS 


NO NERDS


MANAGEMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ADMISSION 


No nerds? Weird. But whatever. 


Upon entering, he sees a big poster on a noticeboard:


NERD SEASON OPENS 5 JULY 


That's today, he thinks. What's this about? 


He approaches the bar to get a drink and order a meal, but as he steps up, the big guy behind the bar gives him a suspicious look. 


""Are you a nerd?"" the bartender demands, with slitted eyes and a sneer on his lips. 


""What? No, I'm a trucker!"" 


""You *smell* like a nerd!"" insists the bartender, and his hand makes its way below the bar.


""Huh? Oh, wait! I've got a big load of computer bits on board. Maybe that's what you can smell on me!""


The bartender relaxes and smiles, and his hand returns to view. ""Ah, - that would be it. Sorry mate. What'll it be?""


The trucker gets his meal and brew, and takes a seat in the corner. 


As he's finishing up, the door opens, and a guy walks in. He's got thin slicked down hair, parted on the left, dandruff on his shoulders, thick glasses and a face full of pimples. He's wearing a short sleeved business shirt, with a pocket protector full of pens, pleated pants that stop well above his ankles, showing white socks below an expanse of pale skin, under black leather shoes. There is a calculator attached to his belt.


The bartender glances up, and doesn't hesitate for even a moment. Hand goes under the bar and comes out with a shotgun, and in one smooth movement he aims and fires both barrels together from the waist. The nerd goes down in a spray of body parts, Biro ink and calculator buttons. 


The trucker is speechless. Wow, he thinks, - they really take their nerd season seriously around these parts. He pays and leaves quickly, somewhat unsettled. 


The night wears on behind the wheel, and the trucker fights the all-too-common battle to maintain concentration on the road. An idiot in a beat-up Commodore blasts past him without enough clear road ahead and merges back early, and instead of holding his line and letting the muppet wear his bullbar, he instinctively pulls to the left and loses control in the gravel on the verge.


The truck goes over and slides into the wall near the end of a cutting, and the containers bust open and spill their contents. The driver pulls himself free, mostly unhurt, and tries to take stock of his position.


Then he hears a rustling on all sides, and as his eyes get used to the gloom, he realises that there are nerds everywhere! They're crawling out from the bushes and from behind rocks, bristling with pocket protectors and calculator holsters, rummaging through the strewn computer parts, comparing them with those that other nerds have grabbed, and bickering over the comparative specs of the various parts.


Anxious to protect what he could of his load, the trucker suddenly remembered what he saw at the steakhouse: nerd season was open! He reached into his cab and found his own rifle behind the seat. Left, right, middle. Blam! Blam! Blam! He started dropping them where they stood.


At that point, he saw approaching red and blues, and a short time later the police were all over everything. 


""Hey! Police! Drop your weapon!"" 


The trucker was astonished. ""Hey, I'm just protecting what's mine! This firearm is registered, I'm licensed, and nerd season opened today!"" 


""Yes,"" replied the OIC, "" - but you're not allowed to bait them!""",1609235910

The pastor knelt beside the man and said, ""I'm so sorry for your loss, I'm a pastor, if there's anything I can do, I'll be glad to help. Was this your father you've lost?""

The man kept sobbing and pounding on the grave. ""No! He wasn't my father! Why did he die! Why did he have to die!?""

""No! We weren't related! Why did he die! Why did he have to die!?""

""No, I never even met the man! But why did he die! Why did he have to die!?""

Confused, the pastor exclaimed, ""Well if you never met him, why are you so upset? Who was he?""

km8twg,Jokes,Artemis1998,This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years.,".....the only friction in their marriage was the husbands habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.

 Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.


The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.


Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. 

About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said ""Honey you were right all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you"". ""What do you mean?"" asked his wife. 

""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in""",1609223046

The guy spends more than an hour in line before getting his tux.

Next he goes to the car rental place, but he's shocked to see the length of the line. He'd forgotten there was a music festival happening the same weekend, of course there'd be a lot of rentals. What's more, their system was down, and they were having to confirm reservations manually. After an *unreal* amount of time, he gets the keys to his swanky sports car and pulls out the lot.

The man manages to get dressed and pick up his date just barely on schedule. They take photos and head to the venue. When they arrive he gives his key to the valet, so they can walk the red carpet. But he simply cannot believe the line he's looking at. He sees a popular rapper near the entrance. They were being swarmed by fans so no one could move forward. Eventually, after what feels like a minor eternity, the man and his date finally entered the dance. 

As they walked in, the dj played his next track. The man's date squeals, yelling that she loved this song and dragging the man towards the dance floor. He's a bit nervous at first but finds his footing quickly. The two are having a great time. 

After a few songs, they step to the side, panting softly. HIs date tells him that she's parched, and he promises to bring her something. He heads towards the refreshments table, looking for some punch. And i know what you may expect, but he was shocked to find there was no punch line.

He goes to the pet  store, looks around and sees a beautiful parrot, sitting quietly on a  stick in his cage. Yet the beast has no feet and paws. ‚ÄúWhat is the  matter with you?‚Äù the man thinks aloud. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs how I was born, I‚Äôm actually a faulty parrot‚Äù says the  bird. ‚ÄúHaha,‚Äù the man laughs, ‚Äúit seems like that parrot understands what I‚Äôm  saying and even answers!‚Äù ‚ÄúI understand everything you say, I am extremely intelligent and very  well educated,‚Äù says the bird. ‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre so smart then tell me how you can stay on your stick  without legs.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù says the parrot, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a bit embarrassing, but okay, I wrap my  little parrot penis around the stick, like a hook, but I hide that with  my thick feathers.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow, you really understand everything I say, do not you?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, yes,‚Äù replies the bird, ""and I speak Spanish and English fluently,  I can speak on a level about almost everything, politics, religion,  sport and philosophy and I specialize in bird science, you should buy  me, I am also a very good friend for you. "" The man looks at the price tag, 200 euros is on it. ‚ÄúSorry, I can not  afford that.‚Äù ‚ÄúPsst,‚Äù whispers the parrot as he beckons the man with his wing closer.  ""Nobody wants me because I do not have legs, just bid 25 euros and you  can take me with you."" The man offers 25 euros and walks 5 minutes later with the parrot out of  the store. A few weeks pass. The parrot is sensational. He is fun and  interesting, gives good advice, is sympathetic to everyone, in short;  the perfect roommate and friend. One day the man comes home from work  and the parrot says ‚ÄúPssssssssssst‚Äù while he beckons his wing again. The  man comes close to the cage. ‚ÄúI do not know if I should tell you this,‚Äù  says the parrot, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs about your wife and the postman.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù says the man. ‚ÄúWell, the postman came to the door and your wife greeted him in a  nothing disguised nightgown and kissed him flat on the mouth.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd then,‚Äù the man hisses, ‚ÄúWhat happened then?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, the postman came in, grabbed her nightgown and started caressing  her everywhere.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy God,‚Äù says the now furious man, ‚ÄúAnd what else did they do?‚Äù ‚ÄúThen he took off her nightgown, went through his knees and started to  lick her everywhere, starting at her breasts and getting further and  further down.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd then, what happened, what else did they do?‚Äù the man screams . ‚ÄúNo idea,‚Äù says the papgaai, ‚ÄúI got a boner and fell off my stick  ‚Ä¶‚Äù",1609183971

klx567,Jokes,BradleyFreakin,Colin was bragging to his boss one day that he knows everyone,"""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Colin how about Tom Cruise?""   
""Sure, yes, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""   
 

So Colin and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door and sure enough, Tom Cruise shouts, ""Colin! Great to see  you! You and your friend come right in and join me for lunch!""   
 

Although impressed, Colin's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Colin that he thinks Colin's knowing Cruise was just lucky.   
 

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Colin says.   
 

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yes,"" Colin  says, ""I know him, let's fly out to Washington."" And off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Colin on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Colin, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a cup of coffee first and catch up.""   


Well, his boss is now very shaken but still not totally convinced of Colin's claim.   
 

After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Colin, who again implores him to name anyone else. His boss pauses for a minute to think of one final person who Colin would never be able to say he knows.

""The Pope,""  his boss replies. 

""Sure!"" says Colin. ""My folks are from Poland, and I've known the Pope a long time."" So off they fly to Rome. 

Colin and his boss are assembled with the masses in Vatican Square when Colin says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let  me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" And he disappears into the crowd headed toward the Vatican.

Sure enough, 20 minutes later Colin emerges with the Pope on the balcony but by the time Colin returns, he finds that his boss has fainted and is surrounded by paramedics. Working his way to his boss' side, Colin asks him, ""What happened?!"" His boss looks up and says, ""I was doing fine until you and the Pope came out on the balcony and the man next to me yelled, ""Who the fuck is that up there with Colin?""",1609183787

klixro,Jokes,Forsoothsayer,Youth Slang,"Kids are always coming up with the strangest slang.  Remember ""on fleek"" or when ""dank"" stopped meaning dingy?

I was working as a counselor at a summer camp one year.  The kids came up with a new one and proceeded to absolutely run it into the ground.  One day in the cafeteria, one of the nerdier boys loudly announced, ""I deem these scrambled eggs worthy.""  Instantly, ""deem"" became the only positive descriptor in these kids' collective vocabularies.  ""Check out this deem lanyard I made.""  ""Archery class is totally deem.""  It drove me nuts.

What's worse, some of my fellow counselors started using it too.  Mostly it was the ones desperate to earn the approval of the campers, but slowly it spread until even the coolest girl on staff would say ""deem"" from time to time.

Speaking of her, she really was remarkable.  All the boys in camp would giggle when she passed by, and I must admit she even challenged my composure when she was around.  Very pretty, air of untouchability, the works.  But most of all, her eyes were stunning, a steel grey color that absolutely stood out.  People said that in low light, they would practically glow.

I bring this up only to insert a momentary brag.  At one point late in the summer, I worked up the nerve to ask her out and she said yes.  We rode into town for dinner, and then, when we returned, I rekindled the campfire, hoping for some high-school-grade canoodling.

I turned to look at her, and, by the way, her eyes did not glow in the low light.  I honestly think she could sense my disappointment, because she said, ""Rumors of my deem eyes have been greatly exaggerated.""",1609128764

There was a large cash prize being offered for anyone who could manage 10 rounds with this fierce animal competitor.

The two boys were jubilant, certain that this was their route to fame.

They planned to rise early on the day that the circus arrived, so they could secure their spot to fight, but one of them overslept. When the early-rising fighter returned home - covered in bruises and claw-marks from his unsuccessful bout - his buddy was sulking and silent.

kl517s,Jokes,Headhunt23,A story of frugality.,"Every morning, the CEO of a large bank in Manhattan walks to the corner where a shoe shine is always located.

He sits on the couch, examines the Wall Street Journal, and the shoe shine gives his shoes a shiny, excellent look.

One morning the shoeshine asks the Executive Director:

""What do you think about the situation in the stock market?""


The Director asks in turn arrogantly:

""Why are you so interested in that - that topic?""

""I have a million dollars in your bank,"" the shoeshine says, ""and I'm considering investing some of the money in the capital market.""


""What your name? ‚Äì""Asks the Director.

""John Smith.""

The Director arrives at the bank and asks the Manager of the Customer Department:


""Do we have a client named John Smith?""

""Certainly ‚Äì""answers the Customer Service Manager‚Äì, ""he is a highly esteemed customer. He has a million dollars in his account.""

The Director comes out, approaches the shoeshine, and says:

""Mr. Smith, I ask you this coming Monday to be the guest of honor at our board meeting and tell us the story of your life. I am sure we will have something to learn from you.""

At the board meeting, the Executive Director introduces him to the board members:

""We all know Mr. Smith, who makes our shoes shine in the corner; But Mr. Smith is also our esteemed customer with a million dollars in his account. I invited him to tell us the story of his life. I am sure we can learn from him.""

Mr. Smith began his story:

""I came to this country fifty years ago as a young immigrant from Europe with an unpronounceable name. I got off the ship without a penny. The first thing I did was change my name to Smith. I was hungry and exhausted. I started wandering around looking for a job but to no avail. Suddenly I found a coin on the sidewalk. I bought an apple. I had two options: eat the apple and quench my hunger or start a business. I sold the apple for two dollars and bought two apples with the money. I also sold them and continued in business. When I started accumulating dollars, I was able to buy a set of used brushes and shoe polish and started polishing shoes. I didn't spend a penny on entertainment or clothing, I just bought bread and some cheese to survive. I saved penny by penny and after a while, I bought a new set of shoe brushes and ointments in different shades and expanded my clientele. I lived like a monk and saved penny by penny. After a while I was able to buy an armchair so that my clients could sit comfortably while cleaning their shoes, and that brought me more clients. I did not spend a penny on the joys of life. I kept saving every penny. A few years ago, when the previous shoe shine on the corner decided to retire, I had already saved enough money to buy his shoeshine location at this great place.

Finally, three months ago, my sister, who was a whore in Chicago, passed away and left me a million dollars.""",1609081412

Once you flip, the unforgiving water makes righting yourself and continuing safely very difficult. 

Bang! The race begins. All three are neck to neck, just keeping up with each other. Then, suddenly, the Christian starts to paddle even harder, thus breaking pace, to pull ahead. Finding a good tempo, the Christian begins to pull ahead of the other two. With the added power of the river, he soon goes out of sight.

Sure enough, the Jew soon finds the now wet Christian and Muslim panting and tired, sluggishly navigating the water. As the Jew passes, the other two begin to rush again. Attempting to cover the distance, they grow unsteady and then flip into the water once more. 

This continues over and over again with the Jew pulling ahead farther and farther. With the end in sight, the Jew wins with a good margin. Panting, the Christian and Muslim ask the Jew, ‚ÄúWe put in so much energy into moving faster. How did you beat us?‚Äù

kkwppi,Jokes,USPSA-Addict,A man is driving down the road one day when his car breaks down in front of a monastery.,"He goes up to the monastery and before he can even ask for help, the monks invite him in, they feed him a delicious dinner, they let him sleep the night, and in the morning, before breakfast, they inform him that they fixed his car overnight.

But during the night, the man had heard a strange noise coming from deep within the monastery. The noise was beautiful and yet haunting‚Äî once he had heard it, he knew he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get it out of his head. And the man could not begin to identify in his mind what was making the noise. So in the morning, over breakfast, the man asks the monks:

‚ÄúHey, what was making that sound from within the monastery?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very sorry,‚Äù they reply, ‚Äúwe cannot tell you, because you‚Äôre not a monk.‚Äù

After a moment of pause the man accepts this. ‚ÄúWell, fair enough, I guess. Thank you so much for everything you‚Äôve done for me.‚Äù And, after the monks refuse to accept any form of payment for their hospitality, the man leaves.

One year later, to the day, the same man, driving the same car, at the same time of night, breaks down in front of the same monastery.

Everything happens as it had the year before. The monks invite him in, feed him, let him spend the night, fix the car, and overnight, the man hears the same sound coming from within the monastery. Hearing it again after all this time, the man now lays awake all night. It‚Äôs as if the sound is calling out to him. By the time morning comes, one thing is clear: the man will never be satisfied until he knows what the source of the sound was.

So in the morning he asks again. And again, the monks tell him that since he is not a monk, they cannot tell him.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve interested me. What do I have to do to become a monk?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have to go around the world,‚Äù they reply, ‚Äúwithout using any type of vehicle that has an engine. And in your travels, you have to count the number of people you see. You do not have to count the number of people in the world‚Äî but you need to count the number of people you see, while you go around the world.‚Äù

The man sets off. He begins traveling immediately after finishing breakfast. Since he cannot use a vehicle with an engine, he figures that his best bet is to use a bicycle to travel the land distances, but the bulk of his journey would happen using a sail boat.

He plots his course, and then navigates it. And with every person he saw, he added to his count. Every person he passed while traveling on the road. Every person in every car that passed him. All the people in the port before he set sail. All the people in the port where he landed. And so on.

Finally, after a great deal of time spent traveling and counting people, he arrives back at the monastery. His car is still parked there. He walks right past it without casting it a second glance, and he knocks on the door of the monastery.

‚ÄúWelcome home,‚Äù a monk greets him.

‚ÄúI made the journey,‚Äù the man says, ‚ÄúI saw Four hundred and seventy nine thousand, seven hundred and sixty two people, including you.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù says the monk, as he embraces the man and leads him into the monastery, ‚Äúthen you are home. You are a monk now. And as such...‚Äù the man pulls out a key which he carries on a necklace around his neck, ‚Äúyou can find what you sought.‚Äù

The monk hands the man the key and leads him to a wooden door. The door‚Äôs surface is worn, but strong. It has been the guardian of the source of the sound for a very long time. The man unlocks the door, and behind the door is a long hallway. Hundreds of yards long, so that it must go deep into the mountain that the monastery sits at the foot of. He begins to walk down it, then he starts to run. He‚Äôs almost there. He can hear the sound growing louder.

At the end of the hallway is a large, steel door. The kind of door that would secure a bank vault. The monk‚Äî who the man had not heard running behind him‚Äî tells the man the combination. Turn right five times and land on 47. Turn left four times, land on 97. Right three times to 62. Finally, left twice, landing on zero.

As he put in the combination he realized it was the same as the number of people he saw as he went around the world.

The locking mechanism clicks and the vault door unlocks. The man turns the handle and pulls back, revealing another, darker hallway. Halfway down this hallway, it opens up into a cavern. But through the cavern, there is a well lit and well worn path‚Äî worn by the feet of all those who have seen the source of the sound. The sound, which was growing louder with ever step. He was so close.

The man arrives at the end of the path. There was a round stone door‚Äî similar to the type of door that sealed Jesus‚Äô tomb. The man goes to one side of the door and pushes with all the strength he has left just to make the door budge, but once he has it rolls the rest of the way to the side.

Exhausted, the man now staggers into yet another, much shorter hallway which is only about fifteen yards in length. At the end of this hallway is a curtain. The man peels the curtain to the side, and is amazed to find out what was making the noise.

But I can‚Äôt tell you what it was, because you‚Äôre not a monk.",1609041597

When he was ready to leave the next morning, certain things had transpired, he told her he didn't have that much money with him but would have his secretary mail her a check for it made out with a memo of Rent for the apartment, to avoid any embarrassment.

On the way to the office, however, after thinking the matter over carefully, he decided the night hadn't been worth what he'd agreed to pay. As a result, he had hi\~ secretary send a check for $250 instead and enclosed the following explanatory note:

*Dear Madam:*

*Enclosed is a check for the amount of $2 50 for rent on your apartment. I am sending this amount instead of the amount originally agreed upon. because when T rented this apartment, I was under the impression that...*

*1. It had never been occupied.*

*2. There was plenty of heat.*

*3. It was small.*

*Last night I found that it had been occupied many times, that there wasn't any heat, and that it was entirely too large!*

Upon receipt of the note, the chorus girl immediately returned the check, with this note:

*I am returning the check for $250. I cannot understand how you could expect such a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied. As for the heat ... there is plenty of it there if you know how to turn it on. As for the size, it's not my fault if you didn't have enough furniture to furnish it.*",1609040749

""Ah, it's a little game we got 'ere"" says the barman. ""It'll cost a tenner to hear the rules but if you pass three tests you get all the money in the jar.""

""Alright, I'm interested. What do I do?"" Says the man, handing over a ¬£10 note.

""Right. Here's the rules - first off, you got to drink this whole bottle of tequila in one minute and keep a straight face the whole time.""

""After that there's a Pitbull out back and he's got a rotten tooth. You gotta get that tooth pit of his mouth without using any tools.""

""And finally there's my great aunt Irene upstairs. She's 102 years old, she's been bedridden and incontinent since 1962, and she's never had sex. You've got to go up there and pop her wrinkled, leathery cherry.""

The man is aghast. ""There's no way I could do all that! I'd barely make it out the door after that much tequila, let alone do the rest!""

""That's up to you"" says the barman. ""But you paid to hear the rules, and I told you the rules, guess this tenner of yours will just have to go to someone who ain't afraid of a little challenge.""

So the man gets stuck into his pint, then another, and another... and eventually bravado gets the better of him.

""Right. Gimme that bottle!"" He demands.

The barman hands him the bottle and the man tears the cap off, and he starts necking it. Gulping it down and with tears streaming down his face, he fights the urge to grimace and somehow polishes it off in 50 seconds flat!

Then he staggers towards the back door, to find the Pitbull chained up to a pole. Before long, everybody inside hears a cacophony of growling, crashing, screaming. And then, silence.

The silence is deafening. For a few long moments everybody fears the worst. Suddenly, the door is kicked open and the man lurches back inside with his clothes ripped to shreds and soaked in blood.

Every morning, the guru returned to the cave to monitor the woman‚Äôs progress. In his hand, he carried a heavy wooden cane.

Each morning, her answer was the same. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúO haven‚Äôt.‚Äù The guru would strike her over the head with his cane. 

This scenario repeated itself for months. One day the guru entered the cave, asked the same question, heard the same answer, and raised his cane to hit her in the same way, but the woman grabbed the cane from the guru, stopping his assault in midair. 

Relieved to end the daily beatings but fearing reprisal, the woman looked up at the guru. To her surprise, the guru smiled. ‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou have graduated. You now know everything you need to know.‚Äù

One night Johnny woke up to some rattling noises downstairs. When he went down to the kitchen, he saw half eaten cookies on the floor and broken glass bowl and Grandpa red faced and yelling while Grandma was trying to calm him down. 

""What's going on?! "" Johnny asked. 
""Nothing to worry dear!"" Said Grandma. ""Some animal broke into the house and tried to eat-""

""Animal?!!"" Yelled Grandpa. ""It's not an animal! I swear to God when I catch that little.-"" 

""Shush George."" Said Grandma. ""You're going to upset the kids. You go to bed, Johnny.  We'll talk in the morning.""

The next morning, over breakfast, Johnny felt Gramps was still a bit grumpy. He ate his food , got up to leave while muttering he was going for a walk and he hoped one of those pesky little critters crosses his path. 

Johnny waited until he left and asked Grandma what it was all about. 

""Well Johnny"" said Grandma. ""Your Grandpa is quite convinced it's not an animal. He thinks it's the magical little people of the forest"". 
""What?!"" exclaimed Johnny and Julie.

""Yeah. He is pretty sure it's a gnome or an elf or one of those things."" 
They all looked at each other uneasily. Johnny was sad. Grandpa had always been strong, full of vigor and  active. It was sad that old age was finally catching up to him. 
It was Christmas Eve and Granny prepared a delicious meal. They had their full and were all sitting around the fire and talking when the topic came up again. 
""I'm going to stay up tonight"" declared Gramps, while taking a sip of his whiskey.
""Tomorrow is Christmas, George! Just get to bed and let's enjoy the holidays with the kids!"" Said Grandma.
""No Martha! This is war! I swear to God when I catch one of those little critters, I'll-""
""Shush George! Not in front of the kids!""

They all said their goodnights and went to bed.
 
It was 3 am. Johnny and Julie woke up startled with loud noises from downstairs. Glass breaking, Grandpa yelling and grunting, Grandma screaming ""George, please stop!"", another strange voice wailing clearly in agony.
They quickly got out of bed, got dressed and ran down the stairs. Meanwhile the noise had died down. 
The scene that they came down to was surreal.

Grandma was standing there with her mouth wide open, shaking and clearly very upset. There were broken glass and pots and pans strewn across the floor. Grandpa was standing on the other side of the room, breathing heavily, with a strange gleam in his eyes and staring at something on the floor. 

""Merry Christmas, you little shit. That should teach you"" said Grandpa with an evil smile.
Johnny and Julie ran around the table to see  what Grandpa was looking at. 

And behold, there was a little elf dragging himself across the floor towards the open door, whimpering, bloody all over. As they watched, the elf, crossed the doorstep, stood up shakily and staggered away into the night.
Johnny and Julie couldn't believe their own eyes. 
""What the hell happened?!' Julie cried.

Johnny took another look at Grandpa and understood. 
After a moment of silence, which felt like an eternity, he turned to Julie and said,

He just had the barely necessities to live there day-in day-out, cultivating his little garden and occasionally hunting too.

Until, one day, a wonderful young woman emerges from the sea wearing a latex skin-tight diving suit, which really toned her already perfect curves..

The beautiful woman sees the weary castaway and with a simple look she understands all the troubles he has passed while stranded so many years in an island without any contact to the outside world.

She approaches him slowly while unzipping her suit a little..

*-Tell me stranger.. How many years have passed since you smoked a good cigarette?*

*-Oh God, here in the island I've found some medical plants to smoke in my pipe, but I haven't had a good smoke since my shipwreck 15 years ago*

And the woman proceeds to uncover a waterproof case with excellent quality cigars from inside her suit.. 

*-Here you can have these*


Stunned the man throws away his pipe and lites a cigar to both of them 

The beautiful woman unzips her suit even more, revealing her pale bare skin underneath 

*-Tell me handsome man.. How many years have passed since you tasted a good liquor?*

*-Oh, the few drinks I managed to salvage from my shipwreck were gone in a year or two.. 12 years have passed surely since I tasted alcohol*

And the woman proceeds to unravel a bottle of 50 years old single malt Scotch Whiskey from inside her suit 

*-Here you can have this*


Ecstatic the man runs in his cabin, takes two hand-crafted clay pots and pours a drink for the two of them

After enjoying the good drink, the mysterious woman continues further.. She unzips her suit to a point that her breasts are only barely covered and her lower half is just out of sight

*-Tell me big boy.. How many years have passed since you had.. Some fun? 
You can have this, she says, while pointing her exquisite body*

*-OH MY GOD, TELL ME YOU HAVE A PS5 IN THERE, I'M OUT OF MY MIND*

The book was called ""main principles of humour"" and she was super invested in that book. At the last page was something called an anti-joke. It was explained that it is something that is not funny and that is the reason it becomes funny. So she started reading examples of an anti-joke and laughing out loud. A postman saw her laughing and said to her - ""do you want to hear the best anti-joke, that is so good it is bad again?"". ""No"" - she replied.

kk04kf,Jokes,Byzarru,One day a man was walking through the forest when he encountered a goblin.,"The goblin shouted at the man and said: ""Foolish mortal, you trespass on sacred grounds! You know not the danger that hides within these hallowed woods!""

The man happened to be Neil deGrasse Tyson, famed astrophysicist and general man of science.

Neil responded simply, ""This is a public park,"" and to that the goblin let out an exasperated gasp and retorted, ""Well, I have a magical patch of dirt. I swore on my life to protect it.""

Neil, bemused, responded, ""This is public property, you can't own any of it.""

""BUT IT'S MINE! THE PATCH OF DIRT IS MINE!"" The goblin screeched back, his voice devolving into a hiss. ""And I will protect my patch of dirt! Since you cannot be persuaded, I will lay defenses to protect my patch of dirt!""

""You, human, should not be able to pass these defenses, but, if you do... and you THREATEN MY PATCH OF DIRT, then... I will CURSE YOU!""

The goblin disappeared suddenly as Neil dwelled upon the goblin's choice of words, musing the word ""defenses"" repeatedly as he continued his walk through the forest.

Eventually, Neil came across a wall, stretching for miles and spanning the entire woods.

The wall was made of burning bricks, unnaturally luminous and searing to the touch. Neil realized that the goblin was serious and this was the first defense he had laid.

The wall was designed to be impassible but Neil overcame the obstacle with ease, as the wall was impassible only to goblins and was short enough for an average sized human to step over.

Neil continued for another mile before reaching the next defense.

This time, it was a deep chasm stretching for miles, cursed so anything that dipped below ground level would freeze instantly, and so unthinkably deep that anything that fell in would surely shatter at the bottom.

The chasm was designed to be impassible but Neil overcame the obstacle with ease, as the chasm was impassible only to goblins and was narrow enough for an average sized human to step across.

Neil continued for another hour before reaching the final defense.

It was another wall, also spanning the length of the entire forest, but was this time merely invisible.

The wall was designed to be impassible but Neil overcame the obstacle with ease by tripping over it; like the other defenses, it was designed for goblins and was so short that Neil did not even realize there was a wall at all.

Neil continued for some time, wondering when he would find the next defense.

He became more wary as he started to notice changes in the scenery. The trees were alien, bearing strange fruit that resembled a cow's udders. The leaves changed from shades of green to impossible shades of pink and blue and fantastic colors in between. Even the scent of the forest, the chill of the air, and the color of the late afternoon sky felt foreign.

This development troubled Neil, but he remembered that as a man of science, he had a commitment to human knowledge and understanding and decided to press on.

In minutes, Neil finally came to a clearing in the woods, which was dominated by a massive mound of dirt. Atop the mound was the goblin, thoroughly engrossed in eating one of the strange, succulent alien udder fruits.

Neil watched for some time before the goblin looked up and screamed, ""YOU BREACHED MY DEFENSES! HOW DARE YOU?! YOU MUST NOT TRESPASS UPON MY PATCH OF DIRT! I PROMISE YOU WILL BE CURSED UNLESS YOU DARE RETURN TO THE FROM WHERE YOU CAME!""

Offended by the goblin's threat, Neil pressed on and walked upon the patch of dirt for science.

The goblin immediately threw the udder fruit to the ground, leaped up, and perched in a tree, ripping off a branch and fashioning it into a wand to focus the magic of the forest. He struggled with the branch but was able to cast his curse upon Neil before he was able to finish his crossing.

Neil was gripped by a wave of energy and reeled from the pain, an overwhelming sensation, feeling as if his skin was evaporating from his body. The sensation was so exhausting that Neil blacked out.

He woke up hours later, the forest now devoid of color as the world was bathed in moonlight. He was still in the clearing and could make out the udder-shaped fruits in the trees, but the goblin and the mound of dirt were gone.

Neil had a dull pain throughout his entire body and knew that it was a result of the goblin's curse. Seeing the moon's reflection in a lake, he ran for the shore so that he may see his reflection.

He looked at the reflection of his face, then at his hands, and at his reflection again before realizing that he had undergone a metamorphosis: Neil deGrasse Tyson was now green.

His skin, eyes, hair, and even his internal organs had taken on a vibrant green color. When he returned home, he found that all of his clothes and furnishings had turned green as well.

Neil never saw the goblin again and resumed his life as normal. He continued to give lectures and host television programs, though was frustrated by a new compulsion to only buy and receive green things. Critics took to calling him a ""little green man"" while his fans called him the ""green science guy."" His newfound color hardly had an effect on his career and he ultimately came to forget about his experience in the forest.

This story was first envisioned a few years ago and until now was only known to a few friends due to its length. It is called ""The Greatest Joke in the World"" because, like all great jokes, it has a moral. To justify the joke's title, the moral of this particular story is the greatest moral of all, and is as follows:

deGrasse is always greener on de udder side of defense.",1608907730

My harp was immaculate, 17th century, with ornate carvings, and was my pride and joy. My girl also loved it, and to show her how much I loved her, I gave it to her as a Christmas present last year.

But this relationship was not to last.

kjxn1z,Jokes,vanimations,A boy growing up on a farm was asked by his mother to do his chores before breakfast.,"He went outside to the chicken coop to gather the eggs but before collected them he decided to chase the chickens around briefly for fun.

He then went to the pig pen with his bucket of leftovers to feed them. When he sees them approaching he decides to dump the bucket on their heads because he's still feeling frustrated by having to do his chores.

Next, he goes to milk the cows. While he is milking the barn cat walks up and he aims the teat at the cat and delivers a stream of milk that sends the cat running.

He returns to the house eager for the hearty breakfast he enjoys every morning. To his surprise, hit plate contains a single piece of toast and his glass has lukewarm water in it...nothing else is on the table. 

The boy asks his mom where his breakfast is and she explains that he would have had some eggs if he hadn't chased the chickens around the coop. She describes the tasty bacon and ham she would have cooked for him if he hadn't dumped the slop onto the head of the pigs and how he could have washed his meal down with some delicious milk if he hadn't sprayed the cat while milking.

As he sat eating his single piece of toast and pondering his lesson about actions and consequences, his dad walks down the stairs and uses his foot to abruptly nudge the cat relaxing on the stairs out of his way and onto the floor a few steps down.

The boy looks at his mom and asks, ""Do you want to tell him or should I?""",1608895965

kjtfpi,Jokes,thunkbunk,Jim's wife makes him get sober,"Jim was a bit of an alcoholic. A good enough guy but he couldn't hold his booze. Jim's wife, Becky, was just about tired of his shit and one night he comes home at 2am drunk as a skunk, stumbles to the kitchen and eats a whole pie. Then crawls to bed and pukes all over the new duvet cover, the mattress and Becky herself. The next day when Jim finally wakes up Becky is packing her bags. She tells him she can't stand his drinking and she's going to her mother's. Jim pleads with her and begs her and promises he'll quit drinking. Becky finally relents but swears that if Jim comes home drunk one more time she'll divorce him. 

All goes well for Jim and Becky for a while. Sober Jim is a good guy. He's thoughtful, shows up to work and even the boss has taken notice. A few weeks go by and things are still going great. On his way home from work one payday,  Jim passes his old favorite saloon. He takes a peek in and everything looks magical in the dusk light. You can hear a loud laugh or two above the murmur of the people inside. Glasses clink and ice is stirred behind the dark mahogany bar. Jazz piano plays quietly from a speaker somewhere . Jim thinks to himself that he could probably have one beer. One light beer and head home. Becky would be none the wiser and a beer sure would taste good on a hot summer evening. 

Jim goes inside and one beer turns into six and then whiskey. Soon enough Jim is shit-faced and pukes all over the front of his shirt. Down his jacket and tie and even on his pants. A true vomit apocalypse. Jim starts quietly weeping, then sobbing. The guy next to him feels sorry for the sack of crap and ask's what's wrong. 

Jim manges to say, between sobs,
""my....wife...is...gonna...leave me."" 


The kind stranger says, ""No buddy, I've been there. What you do is stick $50 bucks in your jacket pocket. Tell the old lady that some drunk puked on you. But gave you money for dry cleaning. And then show her the cash.""

Jim thinks thar sounds reasonable and heads home to face Becky. Jim walks in the door to Becky, hand on hi,  sees him covered in vomit and without a word heads to the attic to grab the suitcase. 

Jim slurs, ""Baby,  baby, baby. It's not what you think. Yes. I'll admit I did go to the bar. And I will admit that I had a couple of beers at the bar. I shouldn't have done that. It was wrong and I am sorry.  But this mess. This isn""t my fault."" As Jim gestures at the parade of puke on his clothes. 

Becky does not say anything and looks very doubtful.

Jim continues drunkenly, ""there was a guy at the bar. Nice enough fella, but got way too drunk and he threw up. All over me."" As jim gestures at his ruined suit. 

Becky still looks suspicious but, after all she does love him, so she wanted to believe it. She continues to listen. 

Jim says, ""but like I said, he was a pretty good guy so he gave me $50 bucks to dryclean everything.""

After many years he finds a theater where they are prepared to give him a chance to shine again. The director says, ""This is the most important part, and it has only one line. You walk on to the stage at the opening carrying a rose. You hold the rose to your nose with just one finger and thumb, sniff the rose deeply and then say the line: 'Ah, the sweet aroma of my mistress.'""


The actor is thrilled. All day long before the play he's practicing his line over and over again. Finally, the time came. The curtain went up, the actor walked onto the stage, and using just one finger he delivered the line, ""Ah, the sweet aroma of my mistress.""


The theater erupted, the audience was screaming with laughter and the director was steaming! ""You bloody fool!"" he cried, ""You have ruined me!""

The actor was bewildered, ""What happened, did I forget
my line?""

""No!"" screamed the director. ""You forgot the rose!""",1608871550

However, if the ear is instead in a down position, the next year will be full of misery and pain (like 2020).

The tradition of checking on the gnu has been passed down from generation to generation, and it is very serious and exciting to be given the honor of carrying it out. Traditionally, the honor is passed down to whoever becomes of age.

Eventually, Mary, a young teen, is given the honor of checking on the gnu that year. On the last day of the year, she excitedly rushes out to check on the animal. However, in her excitement, she forgot her keys to the barn, and is a minute late. She observes that the animal's ear is (wrongfully) in the down position.

Everyone dressed up.,"Many people came as movie characters, from Gandalf the Grey (and White) to Jason Bourne to Black Widow to Harry Potter. Alan Rickman went as Hans Gruber, which made St. Peter exclaim ""See, Die Hard IS a Christmas movie!"" St. Peter was dressed as the ""Fragile"" lamp from A Christmas Story. Moses showed up as Charlton Heston's version of himself, while Charlton Heston dressed up as an ape. Ruth Bader Ginsburg came as Hermione Granger. (Although she insisted that she was dressed as the book character, not the movie character, which explained the teeth.)

There were also some great couple's costumes. Alex Trebek and Sean Connery dressed up as each other and re-enacted bits from the Celebrity Jeopardy sketches. The Wright brothers dressed up as the Super Mario Brothers. Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds came as Captain Kirk and Mister Spock. Prince dressed up as Dave Chappelle's version of Rick James and David Bowie came as ""Super Freakonomics."" 

Naturally, everyone was looking for the guest of honor. If anyone would have a fantastic costume, it would be Jesus.  However, try as they might, no one could figure out Jesus' costume among the multitudes of party guests. There were, of course, plenty of people who dressed as Jesus, and some wondered if Jesus had gone full meta. He didn't, but as it turned out Charlie Chaplin did dress up as Jesus and placed third in the Jesus Look-a-Like contest. 

Finally, as the party was drawing to a close, it was time for everyone to unmask. Joan of Arc was the one dressed as Bigfoot. Alan Turing was Predator. Richard Pryor was the Burning Bush. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, who had long since made up and become the best of friends, were the unicorn.  Eventually there was only one costume left.

When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where.

Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor. 

In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. 

He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom. 

Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.

kjlxs4,Jokes,jvilliards036,"A long time ago, there were two rival kingdoms separated by a mountain range.","The kingdoms always tried to one-up each other at everything: wealth, food, and even the population. They encouraged people to have more babies and try to outgrow the other kingdom in terms of population.

The problem was, however, that one of the kingdoms had an odd rule that no baby could have the same name as the other; each baby had to have a unique name. Otherwise, the family would be banished from the kingdom.

This wasn‚Äôt really a problem until perhaps a decade later when people had run out of ideas to name their children. However, there was a legend that at the top of the mountain range that separated the kingdoms, there was a monk who had the ability to give unique names to anyone who came there.

The people of the kingdom desperately tried to find ways to get up to the top. Every mountain in the range was snow-filled, extremely cold, and steep so it wasn‚Äôt an easy task.

But after the banishment of about a hundred families, one person ended up finding a path to the top that was relatively safe. After that, more people started to climb up the mountain, reach the top, and meet the monk.

The monk did everything they had hoped for: after the parents step in front of the monk, in mere seconds, the monk says a name that had never been heard before, yet was still beautiful.

The monk kept doing this for centuries as even more people kept arriving at the top, asking for names.

Alas, at the turn of a new century, the two kingdoms went to war, one that was so brutal that no person remained alive.

For the next few centuries, the land was desolate and all flora and fauna faded away. That is, until some explorers arrived there as they were traveling throughout the lands to find places to settle and mine for precious materials.

They saw how bad the land was, yet the saw the potential it had. So they brought in even more people to restore the land and build a settlement there. 

As decades and centuries passed, the settlement thrived - it enjoyed great agriculture, a healthy population, and an abundance of precious materials that allowed the population to discover new uses almost all the time.

And as for the mountain range, the people discovered the legend of the monk from some records that they found at the base of one of the mountains.

So, fittingly, they decided to name the mountain range, the Appellation Mountains.",1608840684

Yesterday I went to  Christmas party. I had a few beers, followed by a few cocktails, followed by a few shots...

I still had the sense to know that I was over the limit. That's when I decided to do what I've never done before: I took a taxicab home.

Sure enough there was a police road block on the way home and since it was a taxicab, they waved it past. I arrived home safely without any incident. 

This was both a great relief and a surprise because I had never driven a taxicab before. I don't even know where I got it from and, now that it's in my garage, I don't know what to do with it",1608836167

The wise tree thought about it and said
perhaps the bears can scare the loggers away. The bears snarled and charged the loggers to scare them. This worked initially, but then the loggers hired hunters and soon there were no bears left to scare them. 

The logging resumed and the forest animals returned to the wise tree for advice. The tree suggested that the birds swoop down and peck the loggers to disrupt their work day. This worked for a while until the loggers hired some falconers to hunt the birds. Soon there were not enough birds to halt their progress so the loggers resumed. 

At this point the loggers were getting very close to the wise tree, so the forest animals came back once more to see what the tree had to say. The tree suggested that all the squirrels and mice chew through the cables of their chainsaws and other equipment so that they could no longer cut down the trees. 

While this did slow them down, the loggers quickly switched to manual saws and axes and carried on. 

The day came where the loggers had reached the wise tree and chopped it down. Later that night the forest animals sadly visited the dying tree and asked one last time if there was anything they could do to save the forest. The tree let out a weak sigh and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know guy I am stumped",1608828671

Santa finally came! What did he bring?

A sack full of vaccines, some toilet paper and things,

He came prepared with extra handwash in his stocking, 

Because he knew that Boris was keeping us locked in,

We sat and we cheered opening presents all night! 

As we talked and reminisced about this year's

cancelled flights,

Up on the roof, his red nosed reindeer was seated,

Keeping his distance by approximately 2 metres,

Soon it became time, for Santa Claus to go,

He could only stay til 10pm under new rules on Tier 4,

He flew up my chimney I said, ""When will you be back?""

They hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived in Donegal and he lived in Kerry . 

Paddy consulted with his Sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality Gloves would strike the right note... not too Romantic and not too Personal. 

Off he went with his Sister to Marks and Spencer‚Äôs and they selected a dainty pair of Fur Lined quality, Leather Gloves. 

Paddy's sister bought a Pair of Sexy Knickers for herself at the same time. 

Marks and Spencer‚Äôs had a ""Free Gift Wrap Offer"" on as it was Xmas. But the Shop Assistant mixed up the Two Items, the Sister got the Gloves and Paddy unknowingly, got the Knickers. 

Good old Paddy, sent off his Gift Wrapped Present in a parcel with the following Letter. 

Dear Maggie,
 
I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any, when we go out in the Evenings. If it had not been for my Sister, I would have chosen the Long Ones with the Buttons, but she wears Shorter Ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the Lady I bought them from, showed me the Pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any Marks. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little Bit Tight on Her.

 She also said that they Rub against her Ring, which helps keep it Clean. In fact she hasn't needed to Wash It, since she began wearing them. 

I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other Hands will Touch them, before I have a chance to see you again.

When you take them off, remember to blow into them a little bit, because they will be naturally a little Damp from Wearing.??

Just imagine how many times my Lips will Kiss them during the coming year.

I hope you will Wear them for me on our Next Date.??

All my love,
Patrick.

After calling many Russian tour companies and interviewing many candidates, the couple finely decided on a top notch tour guide named Rudolph Vodkayevsky. The couple and Vodkayevsky instantly connected and things got even better as the interview proceeded. Turns out most of the things the couple enjoyed and liked Vodkayevsky ALSO enjoyed and liked. He also knew Russian cities and the Russian countryside like the back of his hand.
The ONLY issue was that Vodkayevsky didn't like nicknames. He was adamant he be addressed as ""Rudolph"". NOT ""Rudy"". Not ""Rude"" and especially NOT ""Dolph"". Other than that one little hangup, Rudolph was the perfect tour guide. The couple understood and thought they could easily make their tour guide happy with the way they address him.
 Since he was the perfect choice their Russian tour could finally begin.
First stop St. Petersburg and the Hermitage museum. The largest art museum in the world. Rudolph proved very knowledgeable not only in the history museum's contents but where everything was located as well. Shopping and dining also proved to be pure joy as Rudolph took them to the finest places. Five days of pure joy for the couple.
Next stop Moscow with the same results. Rudolph knew all the schedules and locations of anything the couple wanted to enjoy.
After many wonderful days of touring different Russian cities they decided they wanted to get a feel for the Russian countryside and had Rudolph arrange a hike. A long nature hike to leave early, bird watch and come back late. They left the hotel early and had an exhilarating hike to a beautiful location Rudolph knew about. A plateau with a beautiful river and mountains. After a few hours Rudolph warned the couple of bad weather and suggest they get back to the hotel. The couple knew Rudolph was right but begged him to stay another hour. Because the couple were paying him Rudolph allowed it under the condition they don't ask for more time at the end of the hour. The couple readily agreed and spent another hour at the plateau. At the end of the hour everyone got ready and started the long hike back to the hotel.
On the way back it started precipitating HARD. So hard it was difficult to see and the couple formed a line with Rudolph leading the way.
On the way the husband yells at Rudolph so he can hear him ""I'm uncomfortable with it snowing so hard.""

Rudolph: Not snow. Is rain.

The Man: I know what it is. It's SNOW.

Rudolph: No. Is RAIN.

They debate it for some time before the man turns to his wife.
The Man: Is this snow or rain?

The Wife: Rain.

The Man: You KNOW it's snow. Why are you saying it's rain???

First, I went to a wise guru who had a thousand karma. And I asked him, ""Oh wise guru, how do you have so much karma?""

The guru told me the secret of his success. ""Though hard work, you shall gain. Put effort into each post, and redditors will reward you with karma.""

And for a year, I worked hard. Every one of my posts was a masterpiece, one which took months to create, and each one got me a few hundred karma - until, at the end of the year, I had reached a thousand.

But a thousand karma is still so little, so I turned to a noble knight who had ten thousand karma. And I asked him, ""Oh noble knight, how do you have so much karma?""

The knight told me the secret of his success. ""Patience will get you far. Every post and every comment you create will earn you some karma. You only need to make more.""

And for another year, I worked hard and with patience. I made hundreds of posts and thousands of comments across myriad subreddits, and though each only earned me a few measly points they added up - until, at the end of the year, I had reached ten thousand.

But ten thousand karma is still so little, so I turned to a shrewd businessman who had a hundred thousand karma. And I asked him, ""Oh shrewd businessman, how do you have so much karma?""

The businessman told me the secret of his success. ""Luck is what you need. Posts and comments cost little to create, so share them often. Even if most do not get noticed, a few will inevitably go viral.""

And for another year, I worked hard, with patience, and luck. I shared thoughts, opinions, and random pictures across a hundred subreddits, and though most went unnoticed, some went viral - until, at the end of the year, I had reached a hundred thousand.

A hundred thousand karma is a lot, and for a time, I was happy - until I came across a man by the side of the road with a million karma. My heart broken, I asked the man how he had gained so much karma.

The man told me, ""Oh, I just left a few insightful comments and made a few quirky posts here and there.""

I was stunned. ""And that got you a million karma?""

He laughed. ""Well,"" he said, ""no. That got me a few dozen points at most. It's just the reason why I'm on Reddit in the first place.""

""B-but..."" I stammered, pointing at his karma count.

kj70qo,Jokes,saketho,A joke about inflation.,"After spending years studying and perfecting his skills in the STEM fields, a scientist decided to finally put his experiment to the test. He had a great interest in the science of cryogenics - freezing a human being, so that they may freed at a later time in order to preserve the person's age, and basically allowed them to time travel. 

But, like any individual, the man also realised that it was pointless to just run a simple science experiment. What's there to gain apart from knowledge? Why not make it a situation where one could gain knowledge AND money? If he could freeze himself, he would be able to take advantage of inflation!

So, with advice from many highly trained colleagues at his university, the man made a list of places to invest his money. Some stocks, some bonds, some plots of land, a house, an apartment, and so on.

The day had come, and he placed himself into the machine. His employees froze him, and followed his specific instructions.

30 years later, the employees (who have grey hair now), came back to the machine, and unlocked the doors, allowed the man to thaw out and return to room temperature. The experiment was a success! The man had barely aged! He looked the youngest in the room!

But before any of his employees could have a chance of talking to him, the man brushes them aside, and sprints to his desk to find his phone. Naturally, what he wanted to find out first was how much money he had made.

He called his lawyers and brokers. They picked up and said, ""Wow Jimmy! You've made it! Don't you worry, we took care of your assets the best we could, and guess what? You're a millionaire! You're a millionaire many times over!"" He proceeded to explain which assets rose, and how much they rose by, which companies succeeded, etc. 

The man is thrilled! He is ecstatic about being a millionaire! But before he can say anything more to his lawyer, the operator interrupts the call and says, ""Your first 3 minutes are up. That'll be $450,000 for the next 3 minutes.""",1608777526

Boris aligned his mouth with Dominic's butthole for the 56th time in his life. It also happened to be his 56th birthday - though they assured us that was another coincidence. The joining occurred. SAGE watched Boris's vitals as Dominic advised him through what they described as their 'mutual way of understanding each other'.

2. Jam that ham

It was a dark wintry day. Dreary is the right term. Storms ensued outside whilst David decided it was time for his night cap. He left his library to reach for his whisky. He took the finest whisky from his locker and poured a splash into his cup. David felt troubled by the warmth so decided to go for some ice. He walked to his american fridge freezer he got at a higher tariff and opened the door to see the pig's head he left for his little fun evening he planned tomorrow. Desire and rage rushed over David. He couldn't help himself but to give it a go before the boys come over tomorrow. To see if he still has what it takes.

David left the room and sodomised the pig. ""PSYCH GAY BOY"" Boris yelled. ‚ÄúITS ME‚Äù.

Boris frowned.  His dishevelled haircut made it hard for him to be taken seriously, but Carrie knew this time not to poke the pig. ""I will see who I want, Carrie. You know this"". Carrie took a deep breath as her look grew with concern. ""This is not how I envisaged my 30s Boris. You promised me pimms on deck chairs"". ""Well touche to that. I didn't think I'd be dressing up like a pig to get David's fancy again"", Boris chuckled.

After calling many Russian tour companies and interviewing many candidates, the couple finely decided on a top notch tour guide named Rudolph Vodkayevsky. The couple and Vodkayevsky instantly connected and things got even better as the interview proceeded. Turns out most of the things the couple enjoyed and liked Vodkayevsky ALSO enjoyed and liked. He also knew Russian cities and the Russian countryside like the back of his hand.
The ONLY issue was that Vodkayevsky didn't like nicknames. He was adamant he be addressed as ""Rudolph"". NOT ""Rudy"". Not ""Rude"" and especially NOT ""Dolph"". Other than that one little hangup, Rudolph was the perfect tour guide. The couple understood and thought they could easily make their tour guide happy with the way they address him.
 Since he was the perfect choice their Russian tour could finally begin.
First stop St. Petersburg and the Hermitage museum. The largest art museum in the world. Rudolph proved very knowledgeable not only in the history museum's contents but where everything was located as well. Shopping and dining also proved to be pure joy as Rudolph took them to the finest places. Five days of pure joy for the couple.
Next stop Moscow with the same results. Rudolph knew all the schedules and locations of anything the couple wanted to enjoy.
After many wonderful days of touring different Russian cities they decided they wanted to get a feel for the Russian countryside and had Rudolph arrange a hike. A long nature hike to leave early, bird watch and come back late. They left the hotel early and had an exhilarating hike to a beautiful location Rudolph knew about.

One hot summer afternoon a police officer pulls into a yard, gets out, and asks an old gentleman, ""who owns the property?"" The old fella tells the officer that he does, and asks what he can do for him.

The officer, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to inspect your property for illegally grown drugs.‚Äù The old gentleman says, ‚ÄúWell, you go right ahead, but whatever you do, don‚Äôt go into that field over yonder,‚Äù pointing out a fenced parcel of land.

This badge means that I‚Äôm allowed to go wherever I wish, anytime I wish. Do you understand me?‚Äù The old gentleman nodded his head yes politely, softly apologized, and went about his chores.

A short time later, the old gentleman heard someone screaming in absolute terror ‚Äì coming from where he‚Äôd told the officer not to go. He looked over at the pasture and saw the officer running for his life, chased by a very angry bull. With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it appeared likely that the policeman would be gored by the bull‚Äôs horns before he could reach safety.

Realizing the horrible danger that the policeman was in, the old gentleman ran to the field‚Äôs fence as fast as he could, determined to do whatever he could to help. Reaching the edge of the pasture, the old gentleman quickly climbed to the top of the fence, waving his arms frantically and screamed at the very top of his voice, ‚ÄúYour badge, officer, show him your BADGE!‚Äù",1608738162

kiuqt1,Jokes,oldermoose,Avian Flu scare in Massachusetts,"Breaking news... Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.
However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.
MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.
The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah!!"", not a single one could shout ""Truck""!",1608736200

‚ÄúCertainly,‚Äù the Chinese man said, ‚Äúbut one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.‚Äù
‚ÄúOK,‚Äù said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.
Over dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic body. She was obviously attracted to the young man as well, as she couldn‚Äôt keep her eyes off of him during the meal. Remembering the old man‚Äôs warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone.
During the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. Near dawn, he quietly crept back to his room so the old man wouldn‚Äôt hear, exhausted but happy.
He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read:
‚ÄúChinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs easy,‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the best the old man can do then I don‚Äôt have much to worry about.‚Äù He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw it out. As he did so, he noticed another note on it that read:
‚ÄúChinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.‚Äù 
In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted toward the ground he saw a large sign on the ground that read:
‚ÄúChinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bed post.‚Äù

The wife says she‚Äôs way too tired and she just wants to sleep when suddenly an angel appears at the edge of the bed. The angel leans over and hands the husband an ice cream and says if you eat this you will experience the most intense and incredible orgasam of your life. 

Without any hesitation he accepts the ice cream and is immediately overcome with ecstasy.  The wife is quite intrigued and decides she, too, would like some ice cream and reaches out her hand.  The angel is now at the door and says,‚Äù Come, follow me.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, I‚Äôm tired, can‚Äôt you just hand it to me like you did my husband?‚Äù she begs.

‚ÄúNo, says the angel, but it will be worth it, I promise, you just need to work a little harder.‚Äù
The husband offers to help her get her ice cream but he is barely able to keep his eyes open.

The wife gets out of bed and follows the angel who is now at the bottom of the stairs. One step, two steps...she continues...she‚Äôs starting to move quicker now and even builds up a sweat. She‚Äôs  almost there when suddenly the angel is now outside the house.

‚ÄúCome on, you can do it‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúJust a little further. It will be worth it, I promise‚Äù.

The wife is now huffing and puffing but she‚Äôs determined and continues to follow his lead down the street.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he shouts, as he leaves her line of sight.

Finally she turns the corner, her hair is disheveled, she‚Äôs panting and she knows she is so close to finally reaching the ice cream she worked so hard for. At last, she is eye-to-eye with the angel and she extends her hand in quivering anticipation.

The look of shock spreads across the angel‚Äôs face as he responds, ‚Äú Well, it seems I‚Äôm all out of ice cream at the moment but how do you feel about cake?‚Äù",1608730219

Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed Santa even more.

When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More stress.

Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked, and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. So, frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum.

When he went to the cupboard, he discovered that the elves had hidden the liquor, and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider pot, and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw end of the broom.

Just then the doorbell rang, and irritable Santa trudged to the door. He opened the door, and there was a little angel with a great Christmas tree.

The angel said, very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't it a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?""

The first room is big, with a few hundred people standing in piles of shit up to their waists. Other than that, nothing else is happening. They all seem to be having small talk, like they are in some kind of cocktail party, all be it, a boring cocktail party. 

The man tells the demon, ""Uh, maybe we can check out the next room.""

The demon takes him to the next room, and the man is disgusted. This room is huge, with thousands of people in it. There is excrement piled so high, all he sees of the people are just their heads. Thousands and thousands of heads. No one is speaking. They all seem to be trying to keep their heads as far from the crap as possible. The smell, compared to the first room is atrocious. 

The man, cringing, says, ""No, definitely not.""

The demon smiles and takes him to the last room. This one is smaller, much smaller. There are a few dozen people in it. The shit is only up to their knees. They all are drinking coffee or smoking a cigarette. They are all smiling, telling each other stories, and pretty much acting as if they at a family get together. The man smiles and tells the demon, "" This isn't so bad. I'll take this one."" The demon asks if he is sure, looking confused. The man says yes, and walks down the stairs to the bottom of the room. Another demon asks him if he wants a cup of coffee or a cigarette. He chooses the coffee. He's satisfied that he picked the right room to remain in for all eternity. 

Up the stairs, he notices a person who must be the Devil enter the room. He's completely red, a good 7 feet tall, with giant horns on his head. He's holding a clipboard, tapping his teeth with a pen, and pretty much ignoring everything around him but what's on the clipboard. He stands there for a few minutes, checking his watch every so often. Then, with the clearing of his throat, and voice that eminates from air around them, to the walls surrounding them, even to the crap underneath them, the Devil says, ""Okay, everyone, break times over!

At this point the man can't take it. He knows everything will be wrong and he doesn't know what to do to please her. He has no options but to contact his Father for advice. 

He explains the situation and asks his Father what for help. His Father says, ""Listen son, you must be patient. Communicate with your wife and tell her your concerns. I told you this path would not be easy. It is why I never married. You sought this life, now you must seek solutions to your problems.""

The man hated that his father was always correct, but he immediately knew what would make his wife extremely happy. He went to his wife and said, ""Why don't we go explore the bedroom.""

His wife was always ready for sex. She immediately started moaning, Oh God, it is so big.......Oh God, that is exactly how I like it.....Oh God, I am going to cum.....

kiqdgy,Jokes,TATERBONE,Trump and Alien Visitors,"An Alien ship landed at Roswell. Government and military personnel was immediately dispatched to assess the potential of a hostile threat. As the US contingent neared the spaceship a broadcast was sent out by the aliens that said, ""This is Progongon Klopklepeux, I am the leader of the Vodeux Chjis Clan from White Dwarf GD362. We are friendly visitors to all people of Earth. We have absorbed communication and information data from all areas of Earth and want to  request a meeting with your President, Donald Trump.

Within a matter of seconds Progongon Klopklepeux transported himself and President Trump from their current locations to the Roswell Command Center. As soon as Trump arrived he told Progongon Klopklepeux how amazing it was to be transported from Washington D.C. to Roswell within seconds. 

Trump told Progongon Klopklepeuxthat he had proposed the Instant Transport idea to the scientists and technology experts of the United States but they were all a bunch of mental midgets and couldn't devise a way to transport people.

Progongon Klopklepeux introduced himself and explained to President Trump that there was 1,234,567 people from White Dwarf GD362 and they had identified Earth, as a possible settlement.

Trump said, ""You are lucky you came to me. I have the best land and the best buildings throughout Earth. You will really need my help to settle because I am by far the smartest person on Earth. Half the people on the Planet are idiots that will do whatever I say and the other half are all just jealous that I am so smart and¬†powerful.""

Progongon Klopklepeux asked about Earth's difficulty with COVID-19. He was going to offer to eradicate the virus, but Trump quickly stopped him. 

Trump said, ""COVID-19 is nothing, it is like a cold to us. I had COVID-19 and recovered faster than any other person on Earth. I assembled a team and we created a vaccine in record time. It is another disaster that I saved the Earth from.""

Trump then asked Progongon if they had women traveling within the group. Again, Progongon was about to answer but Trump interrupted him and said, ""All the women on Earth are in love with ""The Trumper."" Beautiful, ugly, fat, bitchy, all of the women throw themselves at me. I can set you up with as many women as you want. Just like my good friend Putin does for me when I am in Russia.

The exchange between Progongon Klopklepeux and President Trump continued for about 6 more hours. Each time Progongon asked a question President Trump emphasized how important he would be for the Vodeux Chjis Clan's survival. 

Progongon finally said he had to speak to the 
Vodeux Chjis Clan's leadership council. He immediately transported himself back to the spaceship. Upon his return he immediately summoned the travel crew.

Each of you told me we were landing on Earth but I believe there has been a mistake and we landed on Uranus. I want you to immediately recalibrate our system and recheck all data to pinpoint our location.

The crew left and quickly returned with the data. Progongon, all systems are functioning properly and everything confirms we are on Earth. Progongon, Why would you believe we landed on Uranus and not Earth.

Progongon was at a loss for words. Finally he said, ""I just assumed we had to be on Uranus because President Trump is, by far, the biggest asshole I have ever met.",1608717510

NAME - Greg Bulmash  


DESIRED POSITION - Reclining. Ha ha. But seriously, whatever's available. If I was in a position to be picky, I wouldn't be applying here in the first place.  


DESIRED SALARY - $185,000 a year plus stock options and a Michael Ovitz style severance package. If that's not possible, make an offer and we can haggle.  


EDUCATION - Yes.  


LAST POSITION HELD - Reclining on my mom's couch.  


SALARY - Less than I'm worth.  


MOST NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT - My incredible collection of stolen pens and post-it notes.  


REASON FOR LEAVING - It sucked  


HOURS AVAILABLE TO WORK - Any  


PREFERRED HOURS - 1:30 - 3:30 pm, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday  


DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL SKILLS? Yes, but they're better suited to a more intimate environment.  


MAY WE CONTACT YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYER? If I had one, would I be here?  


DO YOU HAVE ANY PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM LIFTING UP TO 50 LBS? Of what?  


DO YOU HAVE A CAR? I think the more appropriate question here would be 'Do you have a car that runs?'  


HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY SPECIAL AWARDS OR RECOGNITION? I may already be a winner of the Publisher's Clearinghouse Sweepstakes.  


DO YOU SMOKE? Only when set on fire.  


WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE DOING IN FIVE YEARS? Living in the Bahamas with a fabulously wealthy super model who thinks I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread. Actually, I'd like to be doing that now.

At this bar they have a contest. On the bar counter is a large jar filled with 100s of dollars, and next to it is a basket of lemons. 

When asked the bartender will say the same exact story; ‚ÄúFirst you put $100 into the jar, then you pick a lemon, next I squeeze your chosen lemon, and finally you squeeze the same lemon. IF you happen to get 1 more drop of juice, then you win the jar; however, if you don‚Äôt, you put another $100 into the jar.‚Äù

After a few thousand dollars had been lost throughout the night, the small man heads up to the bar. He wiggles and climbs a barstool and puts a crisp $100 bill into the jar.

After the laugher stopped the bartender asked him ‚ÄúAre you sure? You can take your money back.‚Äù  The man insisted and handed the bartender a lemon from the basket. 

‚ÄúOk,‚Äù says the bartender and squeezes it with all of his might. Then he sets it down next to the man‚Äôs notebook and says, ‚ÄúOk, it‚Äôs your go.‚Äù

The man looks at the lemon, looks at the jar, the bar, the bartender, the furniture, then the other patrons, and finally the sock of liquors. The man gets out the calculator, makes some inputs, writes in his notebook and finally picks up the lemon. 

The man turns it over a few times and squeezes it in his tiny hand and he didn‚Äôt get just one drop, nor did he get two, or three, or four. He got seven additional drops of juice. 

As he starts to collect up the money, the bartender asks, ‚ÄúI gotta know, are you some kinda wizard, sorcerer, or mage or something?‚Äù

kihw21,Jokes,CharistineE,Twas the week before Christmas,"‚ÄòTwas the Week before Christmas
by Canttake Itany Moore

‚ÄòTwas the week before Christmas and all through the city
The virus still raged. The year was still shitty.
The cars sat snuggly, all still in the street.
There was no place to go. No friends to meet.
Restaurants were closed. There was no place to dine.
Gifts were all bought, but from only online.
We all wore our masks and had so far survived
But there still were late presents that hadn't arrived.
I threw open the door, from the weather I shivered,
Looking to see if the gifts were delivered.
And then from my TV I heard on the news
The government had granted emergency use!
I sprang to my feet and gave a big whoop
And texted my friends who were out of the loop.
First Pfizer, then Moderna, with others real soon
All will be vaccinated, come around June!
I got on my Facebook and put on my wall,
""Vaccinate, Vaccinate, Vaccinate All!""
And then from outside, I heard a loud truck
And hoped that my boxes had come- with some luck.
As I stuck out my head, and was looking around,
Out of his truck the Amazon guy came with a bound.
He was dressed all in blue with a bright yellow ""A"",
A man on a mission, with no time for play.
His eyes- how very tired! His shoulders, how slumped!
His stride was quite slow. As he moved, how he grumped!
He was exhausted and tired, an overworked elf,
And I sighed when I saw him, in spite of myself.
The bags under his eyes and his general grog
Soon gave me to know he was worked like a dog.
He spoke not a word, but walked straight to the back,
Where he grabbed all the boxes- quite a large stack.
While still on the sidewalk, he tossed them left-handed,
And onto my doorstep they clunkily landed.
He jumped in his truck and turned on the ignition,
Then away he sped off to finish his mission.
But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of view
""Merry Christmas to all, but to Covid, Fuck you!""",1608683079

She came across a church settled near the top of a mountain far away from civilization, and decided to ask for them to lend hospitality to her. A nun greeted her at the entrance when she approached the church, and lead her inside. There, she was given food, water, and shelter for the night. 

‚ÄúYou are free to roam and explore this church‚Äù the nun told her. ‚ÄúYou are our guest and may do as you please. However, you aren‚Äôt to enter the basement under ANY circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not,‚Äù asked the traveler, confused. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs down there?‚Äù ‚ÄúI would tell you,‚Äù the nun spoke slowly with her head down, ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre not a nun.‚Äù The traveler thought the nuns demeanor was strange, but brushed it off. 

When going to her bed for the night, the traveler passed by the basement. She heard strangle sloshing noises, like a damp rag, followed by the sound of a feral animal crying in pain. Disturbed, she found a nun in the church. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on in that basement,‚Äù she asked the nun. ‚ÄúI would tell you,‚Äù the nun said, ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre not a nun.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I become a nun, will I be able to find out what‚Äôs in that damn basement,‚Äù asked the traveler, frustrated. ‚ÄúI mean, I guess so,‚Äù the nun shrugged. ‚ÄúBut are you really willing to put in a lifetime worth of commitment just to know what‚Äôs in the basement?‚Äù The traveler nodded eagerly. Curiosity was ripping her to shreds.

So began her training. For many long years she prayed, preformed rituals, and learned the word of the Lord. Her connection with God strengthened, but so did her flaming need to know what the FUCK was in that basement. After long years of hard work, she finally earned her title as a nun.

‚ÄúSince you are now a nun,‚Äù a nun and the church told her, ‚Äúit‚Äôs about time I show you what‚Äôs in the basement. But first, you must pass a test of your faith. Tell me, which saint saw a flaming and winged figure in the sky when receiving the stigmata?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy, St, Francis of Assisi of course,‚Äù the traveler replied confidently.

‚ÄúExcellent. Next question, name a female saint who is not a doctor of the church.‚Äù

‚ÄúSt. Joan of the Arc, naturally.‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful. Finally, who was the second Pope?‚Äù

‚ÄúSt. Linus. Sister, may I ask how this is a test of my faith?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just messing with you. Come now, I‚Äôll show you the basement. I know the curiosity has been troubling your heart.‚Äù

Finally, after years and years of hard work, the traveler, now nun, was going to discover what was in the basement. She could hardly contain her excitement and pride of knowing the reward for her labor would be soon received. They went down the halls of the church, and to the basement door.

""No problem, just let me in,"" says the senator.


""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""


""There's no need! I want to be in Heaven,"" says the senator.


""I'm sorry, but we have our rules."" And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator, the doors open, and he rides the elevator down, down, down. When the doors open again, the senator finds himself in the middle of a beautiful green golf course. In the distance is a club, and standing in
front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.


Everyone is very happy and in formal dress. They run to greet him, and they reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar.


Also present is the Devil, who is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that, before the senator realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up, up, up, and the door reopens in Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.


So 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by, and St. Peter returns.


""Well, you've spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now, you must choose where you want to spend eternity.""


He reflects for a minute and then answers, ""Well, I would never would have thought it, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better satisfied in Hell.""


So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator, and down, down, down he goes into Hell. Now, the doors of the elevator open, and he is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. And it's hot, hot, hot, and the odor is just horrible.


Sweltering hot. Hot and miserable. The Devil comes over to him and smoothly lays his arm around his shoulder.


""I don't understand,"" stammers the senator. ""The day before I was here, and there was a golf course and club, and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a great time. Now all there is is a wasteland full of garbage, and my friends look miserable.""

khwxsg,Jokes,TOReddical,The Monk,"(Idk what the hell this is but it made a few people I know laugh and I improvised it on the spot. More of an anti-joke?)

So a Tibetan Monk one day leaves his monastery to explore the city of Los Angeles so as to observe the modern Western lifestyle. He is amazed by the towering steel buildings, the speeding vehicles, the energy all around him. 
He finds himself walking into a bar, and strangely enough, no one else commented on his presence. He sits down at the bar, and the bartender asks what he'd like to drink. ""I do not drink alcohol."" The bartender nods and hands him a glass of water, which the Monk thanks him profusely for. The bartender asks ""What brings you here?"", to which the Monk responds ""My legs."" The bartender laughs but the Monk is completely stone-faced. He and the bartender talk about life, the purpose of it, what makes it special, and what an ideal life should be like. The Monk vows against materialism or attachment, and swears himself to a simplistic and humble lifestyle, while the Bartender believes one should try to live life to the fullest, make change, and seek individual happiness. Despite disagreeing, the Monk and the Bartender respect eachothers opinions. As the Monk leaves, he looks back, realizing the bar is empty. ""How peculiar. Perhaps it is a sign.""
As the Monk spent his days exploring the city, and trying to adjust to (but still stay separate from) the urban lifestyle, he decided to see what humanity had accomplished, and visits and museum. He sees the immaculate reconstructions of ancient life, the restorations and intricate analyses of historical sites, as well as how the world came to be. He was impressed, and while curious did not understand the appeal of knowing such things or caring for them, unsure of their impact. The museum, too, was completely empty, however once the Monk noticed this, a Guide approached him. Spoke to him about the processes and planning that went into each of these discoveries and the incredibly amount of thought and effort into uncovering the secrets of a world that was the same as our's, but completely different.
The Guide left shortly after the Monk asked the point of it all, how it impacts life, and how it impacts the future. The Monk seemed alienated, trying to figure out how it relates to what he understood about life. How this energetic and expanding environment constantly accumulated more information, more data, and overly and unnecessarily complex web of information and emotion, almost disgustingly oversaturated. The Guide simply said ""There will be a moment once you realize the beauty of it all. But until then, keep looking until you find that moment."" before leaving. The Monk sought him out but could not find him anywhere in this crowded city,
The Monk decided to visit a psychiatrist so as to help him better understand and work through this crisis. He spent days trying to understand this complete shift in lifestyles and perspectives. Over the course of these days he assimilated more to the lifestyle, though still being completely confounded by it. He then decided to explore what this society has created in the form of art, and decided to visit an art gallery.
He was enamored by the both the intricacy and simplicity of the display pieces. Portraits, sculptures, sketches, carvings, paintings. Even everyday objects were canvases for art, and it was then when the Monk realized the meaning of it all. The connections, the webs, the branching paths and complexities of this modern lifestyle. Each strand had several dimensions to it, and what the Monk previously saw as unnecessary, foolish, naive, and selfish, he suddenly found fascinating. The Monk re-thought everything that had happened since he arrived, even everything that happened throughout his life. Instead of being visited by another guiding figure or helper of some sort, the Monk, while wandering aimlessly having an epiphany, came across a beautiful painting. A painting of himself.
The painting was immaculate and had captured every detail of the Monk perfectly, stunningly realistic. It was as if it had a life of it's own, and it moved exactly how and when the Monk did, almost a reflection of his inner self. It was as if he had been trapped in the magnificent, shining work of art. He walked up to it, and touched the painting, and the painting of himself seemed to touch the exact same spot. Suddenly, the Monk could see everyone around him in the Gallery, though they still all seemed to ignore him. He greeted every single one of them with glee, and immediately decided to heat to his psychiatrist.
""I've figured it out! The meaning of it all... I finally und-"" The Psychiatrist cut the Monk off. ""You have schizophrenia.""",1608607160

Ok people. I'm like, really weirded out. I went to the grocery store tonight and while I was shopping, I noticed this older lady (older than me) kept looking at me. Not like she was going to rob me, but like she knew me. With masks, it happens, but this was more.

I moved to a different aisle and she followed me. Not buying anything, just watching me. Freaky type stuff.

After changing aisles a few times and trying to get away, she finally caught me by the Co Co Puffs.

""Excuse me."" she said. ""I'm sorry, but you look just like my son who was killed in a car accident in 1997.""

I replied ""I'm very sorry that happened, but I assure you, I'm not your son."" and tried to get the Doritos I had come to the grocery store for.

She blocked my path. Apparently, I wasn't getting my Nacho Cheese goodness without an incident. I didn't want to hurt an old lady, but she started crying. ""Jeremy! Jeremy! I love you Jeremy!""

Ok. By now, the vast majority of Kroger is watching. Then, she falls down on the floor screaming and crying.

I was just like ""Lady. I'm sorry but I'm not your kid. I just want my Cheetos and I'm out of here.""

And she was putting on a huge show. She grabbed ahold of me and asked if I could tell her I loved her one last time. She wouldn't let go. The tears and crying were too much. I tried to get away.

Finally, with her clinging to my leg, and pulling harder and harder, she said ""Sir, you are pulling these people's leg, way harder than I'm pulling yours.""

khonaz,Jokes,amerkanische_Frosch,The Sensitive Man,"A man and a woman meet in a singles bar.  They chat, they click, they connect.  The fellow proposes that they continue their discussion over drinks at his place.  The woman agrees.

They arrive at his apartment, and the woman is genuinely pleasantly surprised to see that, unlike a lot of bachelor pads, the apartment is tastefully furnished.

They sit on the couch and have a few drinks.  He leads her to the bedroom and she is even more pleasantly surprised to see that one wall of the bedroom is completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddy bears on three shelves.  

It's obvious that he has taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them. She's immediately touched by the amount of thought he put into organizing the display.

There are small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf.

She finds it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears. She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but doesn't mention this to him.

They have a few more drinks and continue talking. After awhile, she finds herself thinking, ""Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one! Maybe he could be the future father of my children?""

She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips.

He responds warmly. They continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her onto the bed.  They rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.

She is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known.

After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow.

The woman rolls over, gently Strokes his chest and asks coyly,

'Well, how was it?'

The guy opens q drawer on his nightstand, pulls out a little black book, consults a few pages, does some rapid calculations and says:

It begins to annoy him so he goes to the doctor and asks for help. The doctor has an odd suggestion - that sometimes women are too warm and this impedes the process. So all he has to do is buy a fan and put it in the room, and it'll solve the problem.

At the hardware store Jimmy looks at all the fans on offer but - he's a little cheap and cantankerous - he thinks they're all too expensive and this is some kinda 'Big-fan racket' that he'll outsmart.

He drives back and calls into his neighbor Murphy, explaining the scenario. He brings Murphy into the bedroom with his wife and hands him a tea towel, telling him to stand in the corner and flap the tea towel so that his wife will remain cool. Murphy is confused but goes along with it. 

Jimmy gets into bed and gets started while Murphy flaps away in the corner. An hour goes by - nothing, and Murphy's hands are getting tired. Finally Murphy suggests they swap places, to see if that helps. Jimmy and his wife agree, so Murphy gets into the bed and Jimmy flaps the towel. Within five minutes Jimmy's wife is screaming in pleasure with the most intense orgasms she has ever had, and within ten minutes they're both flopped on the bed, exhausted.

Jimmy walks up to Murphy, triumphant. ""You see that?"" he says ""That's how you flap a tea towel""",1608572540

Little did the fly know, there was a very hungry fish beneath it looking for some lunch. The only problem was that the fly was just a few inches too far above the surface of the water, so the fish had to wait for the fly to come down before it could jump to get it.

Unfortunately, the fish was so caught up in waiting for the fly to move, that it did not notice the grizzly bear wading through the water. The bear had spotted the fish, but the fish was just a little too deep to get, so the bear decided to wait until the fish came up, so it could grab its meal.

Meanwhile, on the riverbank sat a hunter and his faithful feline companion, who had been wandering through the woods all day, when the hunter spotted the largest grizzly bear he had ever seen. If the bear moved down just a touch, the hunter would have the perfect shot to kill it and take it home.

While waiting for the bear to move, the hunter munched quietly on a few crackers he had been saving all day. Unbeknownst to him, his crumbs had attracted a small mouse, who was frantically scurrying about trying to get all of the scraps without being noticed.

But it was too late for the mouse. The hunter‚Äôs cat had seen the mouse and was stalking it patiently. The cat knew that if the hunter fired his gun, the mouse would run away, directly towards the cat.

The mouse paused, sensing danger, and the entire forest came to a standstill. The cat was waiting for the mouse, the hunter was waiting for the bear, the bear was waiting for the fish, and the fish was waiting for the fly. All that could be heard was the flow of the river and the soft buzzing of the clueless fly.

And then it happened. The fly buzzed its way down right to the surface of the water. The fish jumped, mouth open wide in anticipation of the fly. The bear, seeing the fish move, lunged with paws outstretched, exposing its broadside to the eager hunter. The hunter seized the moment and fired his gun at the bear with a deafening sound that filled the forest. The mouse, terrified, took off, trying its best to escape the noise, but in its confusion, the mouse ran away from the cat towards the river. The cat, startled by the difference in its plan, scrambled after the mouse, not realizing how close the river was. The cat pounced, but its frantic efforts had caused it to misjudge its leap, and the unfortunate feline screeched as it fell headfirst into the water.

The hunter, who had watched the entire scenario play out, all the way from the fly to his now-soaking cat, sighed in exasperation. ‚ÄúWell, I think we all know what happened here,‚Äù he said to the cat. ‚ÄúWhen the fly drops, the pussy always gets wet.‚Äù",1608569891

My dearest darling Edward,

What a wonderful surprise has just greeted me! That sweet partridge, in that lovely little pear tree; what an enchanting, romantic, poetic present! Bless you, and thank you.

Your deeply loving,

Emily

Dec 26

Beloved Edward,

The two turtle doves arrived this morning, and are cooing away in the pear tree as I write. I'm so touched and grateful!

With undying love, as always,

Emily

Dec 27

My darling Edward,

You do think of the most original presents! Who ever thought of sending anybody three French hens? Do they really come all the way from France? It's a pity we have no chicken coops, but I expect we'll find some. Anyway, thank you so much; they're lovely.

Your devoted Emily

Dec 28

Dearest Edward,

What a surprise! Four calling birds arrived this morning. They are very sweet, even if they do call rather loudly - they make telephoning almost impossible - but I expect they'll calm down when they get used to their new home. Anyway, I'm very grateful, of course I am.

Love from Emily

Dec 29

Dearest Edward,

The mailman has just delivered five most beautiful gold rings, one for each finger, and all fitting perfectly! A really lovely present! Lovelier, in a way, than birds, which do take rather a lot of looking after. The four that arrived yesterday are still making a terrible row, and I'm afraid none of us got much sleep last night. Mother says she wants to use the rings to ""wring"" their necks. Mother has such a sense of humor. This time she's only joking, I think, but I do know what she means. Still, I love the rings.

Bless you,

Emily

Dec 30

Dear Edward,

Whatever I expected to find when I opened the front door this morning, it certainly wasn't six socking great geese laying eggs all over the porch. Frankly, I rather hoped that you had stopped sending me birds. We have no room for them, and they've already ruined the croquet lawn. I know you meant well, but let's call a halt, shall we?

Love,

Emily

Dec 31

Edward,

I thought I said NO MORE BIRDS. This morning I woke up to find no more than seven swans, all trying to get into our tiny goldfish pond. I'd rather not think what's happened to the goldfish. The whole house seems to be full of birds, to say nothing of what they leave behind them, so please, please, stop!

Your Emily

Jan 1

Frankly, I prefer the birds. What am I to do with eight milkmaids? And their cows! Is this some kind of a joke? If so, I'm afraid I don't find it very amusing.

Emily

Jan 2

Look here, Edward,

This has gone far enough. You say you're sending me nine ladies dancing. All I can say is, judging from the way they dance, they're certainly not ladies. The village just isn't accustomed to seeing a regiment of shameless viragos, with nothing on but their lipstick, cavorting round the green, and it's Mother and I who get the blame. If you value our friendship, which I do (less and less), kindly stop this ridiculous behavior at once!

Emily

Jan 3

As I write this letter, ten disgusting old men are prancing up and down all over what used to be the garden, before the geese and the swans and the cows got at it. And several of them, I have just noticed, are taking inexcusable liberties with the milkmaids. Meanwhile the neighbors are trying to have us evicted. I shall never speak to you again.

Emily

Jan 4

This is the last straw! You know I detest bagpipes! The place has now become something between a menagerie and a madhouse, and a man from the council has just declared it unfit for habitation. At least Mother has been spared this last outrage; they took her away yesterday afternoon in an ambulance. I hope you're satisfied.

Jan 5

Sir,

Our client, Miss Emily Wilbraham, instructs me to inform you that with the arrival on her premises at 7:30 this morning of the entire percussion section of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and several of their friends, she has no course left open to her but to seek an injunction to prevent you importuning her further. I am making arrangements for the return of much assorted livestock.

I am, Sir, yours faithfully,

khhunt,Jokes,RASGAS23,Nate the Snake (Long),"There once was an island in the middle of the ocean, shaped somewhat like a dog bone, with two populated ends separated by a long narrow strip of land with a highway connecting the two ends of the island. 

Oddly enough, the entire island was held up from sinking into the ocean by a big lever, which sat in the very middle of the island, in the median of the highway. The land was so narrow that there was barely room for the highway, with no shoulder on either side, and just enough room for the lever in the median. Everyone knew If this lever was ever pulled the entire island would sink. 

This island also had a very old, very friendly snake named Nate, who was the unofficial mascot of the island. He was well known and loved by all the islanders, and was very old. 

One day, a man was driving from one end to the other, and as he was nearing the middle of the island he saw something in the middle of the road. As he got closer he realized it was Nate, crossing the road. He started to swerve into the other lane, to avoid running over Nate, but realized he was coming up on the lever, and if he swerved he would sink the entire island, killing everyone. 

At the last second, he made the fateful decision to... run over Nate, killing him instantly. As he drove away he looked in the mirror and saw the dead snake, smushed in the middle of the road, shrugged his shoulders, and muttered

khfbw9,Jokes,TrueGarden4821,My job is so fucking unbelieveable.,"I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:
First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.
The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a¬†cat¬†in heat.
But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking¬†dog¬†to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.
Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",1608548954

The next day, he tied them both up in the middle of town. He hung signs charging $5.00 to kick the rapist in the groin and $5.00 to hit the con man in the face. He figured this was fair as it punished  how each committed their crimes.

The whole town lined up and things were going well. One guy, who waited for hours in the line for the con man, finally got to the front. He took one look at the face of the con man and figured it as so battered that hitting him in the face wouldn't do anything more.

He leaned back and started to  deliver a whopping kick right to the con man's groin!  Before he could follow through, the Sheriff yelled at him to stop.  The man was confused until the Sheriff told him this was the punch line.",1608535032

khb6ku,Jokes,ThomBraidy,There once was a man,"There once was a man - an old man - weathered and weary from spending the past 60 years of his life as a man of the sea.

He had survived it all: war, weather, business. He had seen just about every major body of water known to man. The seven seas, the fours oceans, the great lakes and nearly a thousand more.  Rumor had it he had sailed the 100 longest rivers on the planet.

There were rumors of his heroics, too. As a young man the local newspapers in coastal New England wrote about how he saved 17 soldiers lost at sea due to a hurricane.  The cute thing was, he had just turned 11.  The Navy tried to enlist him on the spot (and eventually he did serve) but he also knew that being out on the water offered more potential than just saving people. He could use his navigation abilities to transport goods for lots of money.  He could fish, maybe even illegally as the years went on, who knows.

Every so often he would return to the town he grew up in, where he first learned to sail.  He yearned for the days of his youth when he could freely sail without obligation.  At first the locals would take note of his ship being in port.  They'd cheer for him to come to land, let them but him a beer. Even the paparazzi showed up once or twice. Occasionally he obliged but mostly he would just stay on his ship, getting some rest for the new day ahead.

As he finally achieved financial independence and began his retirement, he decided to stay for a few nights in his home port.  He moseyed on up the coast and snuggled into his slip.  Of course, long gone were the days of cheering crowds or flashing cameras, and the old man relished in his memory of his moderate fame. Nevertheless, he had enjoyed his life and looked forward to the rest of it. At daybreak, he would sail, he would sail freely on the waters he knew oh so well.

What started as a long weekend turned into a summer-long affair,  He had almost forgotten how much fun it was to sail without a sale on the line, and considered if he might be having his very finest aquatic moments yet. In his seventies!

One day, the old man realized he needed some supplies, and stepped ashore. He headed into town, to the local hardware store, and began collecting his needed items.  As he was checking out, the cashier gave him a knowing smile.  She was an aging woman, tired from a summer dealing with tourists and their bratty children making a mess in the toy aisle. A working man was a sight for sore eyes.

The old man blushed, and tried to think of clever thing to say. ""Thanks, I'll have my stuff now"" is what came out.  Woof. It had been a while. 

""OH! um, yes sir. Best of luck, sir."" She replied, giggling. The old man was a little flustered, a little unsure of himself, and hesitated to respond. She continued, ""I think I remember you...you..youre the sailor, right?""

""Um. Well, I am a sailor."" he replied.

""No no you know what I mean.  You're.. whats your name. You rescued those men- er...boys - all those years ago. I... think we went to school together.""

The old man was stunned. Well, maybe he shouldnt be so stunned, it is the town he grew up in, but he certainly was surprised and charmed.  After all these years, hardly stepping foot on land, and he was recognized as a hero within an hour by a random stranger.  He eventually found his words and asked her out on a date the following night.

They met at the same time, same place, just as her shift was ending. They had a marvelous evening of conversation, food, and wine. As the night carried on, they began to wander down toward the local marina.  There was a big beautiful moon that night, and there is no better place to see a big beautiful moon than right on the water.  They made their way onto the old mans ship, and looked up at that great big wheel of cheese in the sky.

""Well I have to say, I don't know how you did it. 60 years on the water, and its not like this boat has a ton of space.  Do you even have a bed?"" the old woman asked, clearly hinting that she was feeling amorous that evening. The old man picked up what she put down, and took her down below to his bed.

""Wow, there is not a lot of room here for two people. How have you managed to date all these years?""

""Well,"" the old man replied, ""the truth is, I haven't managed to date very often over the years. But, I don't know if I'd say its the bed's fault. It's a comfy enough bed for me, and I dated a few women while I was stationed during the war. But ultimately, I've been most comfortable just alone and at sea.""

This time, the old woman didn't know what to say. She stared at the moon, hoping for a kiss.

""Plus,"" the old man continued, ""I can just flip my legs up over my head and deepthroat myself when I need to cum.""",1608529492

She hasn't had sex in nearly eleven years.
But she is just too buisy with her job to hold a decent relationship and doesn't want to just whore around like a hooker.
Desperate for action she visited a sex shop to get a sex toy, this being her first visit she was visibly embarrassed as she looked over the wares. 
The cashier saw her embarrassment and also noted that Betty couldn't seem to make up her mind so decided to help.
The cashier pointed to a box and said it was a voice activated dildo. Ten inches long and an inch and a half thick, ribbed for extra pleasure.
It would be free to Betty if she promised to give feedback on how well it worked.
She agreed and read the instructions on the box. They were simple, she just had to say, 
'voodoo dick my...' and end the sentence with where she wanted it to go.
As she drove home she just couldn't wait to try it. Opening the box and pulling off her pants and panties as she drove she said, 'voodoo dick my pussy'
The dildo flew right up and in. Vibrating like crazy.
Betty felt amazing but was driving erratically, noticing the potential danger she wanted to shut it off but realized she didn't read that part of the instructions.
Her driving had caused the box to slide under the seat and she was all over the road.
Soon enough she saw police lights and did her best to pull over.
The policeman tapped on her window and she rolled it down.
He asked if she was on drugs.
'No!' she moaned.
Have you been drinking? He asked next.
'no...' she gasped

As soon as he entered the first thing he saw was a blow up doll but soon dismissed the thought of buying it since it's almost like another human, he then proceeded to the dildos section. 

There he saw all kinds of dildos, from massive to tiny to ones which glow in the dark but none of them grabbed his interest so he decided he'll go somewhere else and begins to leave the shop when he was stopped by the owner sitting behind the cash counter. 

""I know what you're looking for"", the owner says 

This grabbed the businessman's attention and he stopped to hear what the owner had to say. 

""There was a man many years ago who looked just like you, wealthy but tired. He had a wife whom he couldn't satisfy and she was about to leave him when he came here and got my help. He's happily married since then"" 

""How exactly did you help him?"" Asked the businessman.

The cashier bent down and revealed an engraved wooden box from under the counter. There were all sorts of symbols on the box. He opens it and inside it was a pink latex dildo, similar to the ones on the shelf. 

""This is an ancient artifact haunted by a Maori tribe who all died of sex deprivation when all the women of their village were killed in a plague, all their souls now reside in this dildo"", said the owner. 

The businessman being a sceptical guy laughed and then turns to leave. 

The owner says, ""You're all the same, thinking there's nothing above this material plane of existence. Watch this."" 

The businessman turns around. 

""Voodoo Dildo, keyhole"" 

To his astonishment, the businessman saw the box violently shake and the dildo rise in the air, float for a second and hover over to the keyhole in the front door and start to fuck it. The dildo fucked the keyhole with such force that the door unhinged and started cracking. 

""Voodoo Dildo, box"" 

The dildo stops fucking the door and returns to the box. 

""ILL TAKE IT"", screamed the businessman, and after a lot of negotiation he finally purchased the dildo and ran home. 

He tells his wife about the dildo and how to use it. ""Voodoo Dildo, pussy. That's how you activate it"", the businessman told his wife and went on his business trip. 

After 3 days of being horny the wife finally gave into her urges and opened the wooden box, took out the dildo and uttered ""Voodoo Dildo, pussy"". The dildo shot from her hands and started fucking her. First slowly and then changing speed as the way she wanted. 

After an hour of fucking, the wife thought it was enough and she grabbed the dildo. But it didn't stop fucking her. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to stop the dildo. 
She started panicking and called him but he didn't pick up so she started to dress up and go for the hospital, all the while the dildo still fucking her. 

She got in her car and started driving. On the way she had a huge orgasm and her car served and almost hit another car. A police car saw this and she was stopped at the side of the highway. A policeman approached her. 

""Ma'am you almost hit the grey SUV back there, have you been drinking?"" 

The wife then proceeds to tell him all about her husband and the voodoo Dildo and that she can't stop it now. 

The policeman then says, 

""Yeah right, Voodoo Dildo my ass.""",1608482026

The only other thing on the island was a tall coconut tree, which provided their food. 

Each day, one of the lawyers climbed to the top of the tree to see if he could see a rescue boat coming.

One day, the lawyer yelled down from the tree, ""Wow. I can't believe my eyes. There is a girl out there floating in our direction.""

The lawyer on the ground was very skeptical and said, ""I think you're hallucinating and you should come down right now.""

So, the lawyer reluctantly climbed down and told his friend that he had just actually seen a naked blonde woman floating face up... headed toward their island. The other lawyer started to laugh, thinking his friend had surely lost his mind. But within a few minutes, up to their beach floated a naked blonde woman, face up, and totally unconscious.

The two lawyers went over to her and discovered to their amazement that she was still alive. One said to the other, ""You know, we've been on this island for months now without a woman. It's been a long time. Do you think we should, you know , screw her?""

kgw0sp,Jokes,S2Charlie,A man wakes up in a dingy slum,"With no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",1608478675

""Are you kidding me?"" The bartender replies, ""you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?""  

""HE'S ON TO US"" mathematician #1 screeches  

Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.  The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. ""FOOLS"" it booms in unison, ""I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA""

The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. ""But wait"" he inturrupts, thinking fast, ""if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!""  

The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. ""My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!"" and with that, they vanish.  

A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. ""How did you know that that would work?""  

""It's simple really"" the bartender says. ""I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.""",1608449562

After having witnessed this a couple of times, I asked her why she did this.
""Oh, that's the way my mom teached me how to prepare sausages, she always made them like this for my father and myself""
Shortly after this we went over to her parents for a visit, and she brought up the question :"" Mom, why do you cut off an inch on both sides of the sausages before baking them""
""That's the way my mother, your grandmother, thaught me how to prepare them, I've never know otherwise""
As end of the year approached we had a big family gathering and also my wife's grandmother attended, and towards the end of the evening my wife and I sat down next to her ""granny, we were wondering, I've been cutting of an inch of both end of sausages, because that's how mom thaught me, and she said she learned it from you, why is that?""
""Oh dear, it's indeed a bit weird, but it's my mother, your great grand mother, that came up with that, she surely can give you an answer""
My wife's family is blessed with good genes, and they grow quite old, so her great grand mother is still alive, and living in a nursery home.
Because of the years end we decided to visit her and pay our respect, and with me driving, my wife, her mother and her grand mother came along, as they were a bit curious now to.
We arrived in her room, and after paying our respects and wishes for the new year, my wife's grandmother sat down next to the bed and asked "" mother, we have a question, we were wondering, we've been thaught to cut of an inch of both sides of sausages before baking them, and so are my daughter and grand daughter perparing them, it's you who told me to do it, but why is that?""

Clarence and Earl are in a conundrum now, since they ran out of ears to clip off. Clarence then has an idea and tells Earl ‚Äúhow ‚Äòbout we clip the tail off of your pig Earl, seeing as they both have no ears now‚Äù. Earl agrees and they clip the tail off of the poor earless pig.

The Genie tells them it‚Äôs time for their second wish. The first guy says: ‚ÄúI want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.‚Äù POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. The second guy says ‚ÄúI want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want.‚Äù POOF, his looks change and the first guy‚Äôs wife immediately starts flirting with him. The third guy says ‚ÄúI want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die.‚Äù POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. 

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. The first guy does, and after a while says ‚ÄúI never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.‚Äù POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don‚Äôt bother him anymore. The second guy says ‚ÄúI never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.‚Äù POOF, he looks younger already. The third guy smiles triumphantly and says ‚ÄúMy last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.‚Äù POOF, he‚Äôs now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. 

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.

What's with you and those birds???? Seven swans-a-swimming. What kind of joke is this? There's bird do-do all over the house and they never stop the racket. I'm a nervous wreck and I can't sleep all night. IT'S NOT FUNNY.......So stop with those birds.

Sincerely, Agnes

December 21st

OK Buster:

I think I prefer the birds. What am I going to do with eight maids-a-milking? It's not enough with all those birds and eight maids-a-milking, but they had to bring their own cows. There is poop all over the lawn and I can't move into my own house. Just lay off me. .

Hey:

What are you? Some kind of sadist? Now there's nine ladies dancing. The cows are upset and are stepping all over those screeching birds. No wonder they screech. What am I going to do? The neighbors have started a petition to evict me. You'll get yours.

From Ag

December 23rd

You Creep!

What's with the ten lords a-leaping on those maids and ladies? I don't know why I call them ladies. Now the cows can't sleep and they've got diarrhea. My living room is a river of poop. The commissioner of buildings has subpoenaed me to give cause why the building shouldn't be condemned. I'm calling the police on you.

One who means it, Ag

December 24th

Listen Idiot:

Now there's eleven pipers piping, but they play more than their pipes. They've been balling those maids and ladies all night long. Meanwhile, the lords have run through them all and begun committing sodomy with the cows. All 23 of the birds were trampled to death. I hope you're satisfied, you rotten swine.

Your sworn enemy, Miss Agnes McCallister

Although he experienced low approval numbers during the lockdowns, he recently hit his highest approval rating of his career, due to America's excellent performance in preventing the spread of COVID in hindsight, after seeing how European countries like Sweden performed.

In addition, despite losing the house and senate in the 2018 midterms, the Obama administration managed to narrowly pass a bipartisan resolution granting citizenship to any people from Hong Kong who entered the United States.

With the passage of this bill, Obama invited over a hundred recently naturalized Hong Kongers to Washington for his State of the Union, to show that America is a country of immigrants, and express his pride of what Congress managed to achieve.

Obama steps up on the podium ready to give his speech. He pauses for a brief moment, and looks at the politicians all around him. He then looks at the hundred Asian citizens in the front of the audience, and shows a slight smile.

He angles his mic, and is now ready to begin his speech.

He ordered the tallest vanilla ice cream he could hold between his vestigial wings... those miserable fins could barely manage the scoops upon scoops of creamy goodness. The cone was so tall that more of it ended up on the penguin than in him!

""Yummy! That was very very good!"" the penguin said, smacking his lips.

He waddled back to the mechanic who was ready to give the little fellow an update. The mechanic looked at the penguin sternly. The gaskets and seals on the engine were severely damaged after years of driving without a routine check, and it was certainly going to be expensive.

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""But I still think you American spy.""

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

The cops got there and she was insisting they charge me with anything they could. Thankfully for me, they said there wasn‚Äôt much they could do because my city won‚Äôt charge someone for inadvertently killing an animal.  


At that point, my neighbor was furious and demanded she gets some sort of justice. The cops asked her what she wanted and she said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll I need at least $500‚Äù. I started to panic and really didn‚Äôt want to fork over $500 no matter how bad I felt.  


I look over to the cops hoping that doesn‚Äôt have to happen and to my surprise, the cops were putting my neighbor in handcuffs. At this point, I just consider myself lucky and stopped talking while my neighbor is screaming and asking what they‚Äôre arresting her for.

During the unrealistically lax visitation sessions, one cellmate covertly swipes a pair of safety scissors when nobody is looking, and hides it in a body cavity. Miraculously, the scissors were not discovered during post-visitation searches, and they manage to get the craft scissors all the way back to their cell.

They spend all night trying to cut through the floor tiling with safety scissors, but all the scissors do is uselessly bonk on the linoleum, leaving hardly a scratch in the tiling over eight hours of attempted cutting. Come morning, they're still trying to cut through the floor with scissors, when the day guards catch them using contraband.

kfp4ld,Jokes,LordIggy88,"In medieval times , a magical witch child was born in a hospital...","The child was named Ai by her mother, as it reminded her of her beautiful blue eyes. The mother was a scientist, creating many experiments and potions. She was well known in the village for creating many antidotes, prescription drugs and potions. 

Ali‚Äôs father, on the other hand, was a world renowned chef. His cuisines were delicious and varied; some had sauces, some had ice, some had veggies and some had spice. They both had dated for a very long time and were interested in each other‚Äôs careers.

One day, while Ai‚Äôs father was preparing a pasta dish, some of Ai‚Äôs mother‚Äôs potions got accidentally mixed in, and when she ate the dish, something unexpected had. The child Ai ingested the Magic concoction in the womb, so 9 months later, she was born a witch.

Her parents could tell by her green shade, pointy ears, and the mole on her nose. The child Ai used her magic  telekinesis powers to grab a nearby binky, and Ai put it in her mouth. 

This was when  her parents knew they had to keep her secret from the public. So Ai usually spent her time inside, alone, reading books and eating her father‚Äôs meals. 

She was a kind hearted child, but Ai eventually got sick of staying indoors. She had planned a way to sneak out of her cottage during the night. Ai dogged a tunnel through her basement out to the backyard. It took forever, but Ai finally escaped her home.

When Ai flew around in the sky, she had finally felt free. She had worn a disguise with sunglasses, a scarf and green dress. 

She decided to fly down to the village‚Äôs festival to see what it might be like. There were balloons, exotic fruits, cheeses and meats, music, dancing, the whole shebang. 

Ai‚Äôs attention was caught at a pretty little green ring that only costed 10 cents. She didn‚Äôt have any money, and she hadn‚Äôt thought of how she could get any. 

Suddenly, Ai‚Äôs attention was drawn away from the ring and towards a lonely boy with ripped clothes sitting on a fountain. She flew down in the distant trees and walked over to him and sat down next to him. 

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù The boy asked with a sad tone. ‚ÄúI just wanted to say hi!‚Äù She said with a little wave and smile. ‚ÄúWhy would you want to say hello to ME?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve never had any friends before! By the way, my name is Ai.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Yurt. Sorry if I came off as rude, it‚Äôs just I have a terrible secret I can‚Äôt tell anyone.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat is it? You can tell me anything!‚Äù Ai said positively. ‚ÄúWell; my family is poor. Everyone else here is rich, when our family can only afford one loaf of a bread a week!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! Is there anything I can do to
help you? 

‚ÄúWell... I‚Äôve always wanted to try one of those fruit kabobs, but... the rich kids are over there. They always make fun of me for not having any money! If it isn‚Äôt too much to ask... could you take this dime and buy one for me?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù Ai said happily.

So Ai got up and walked over to the table with fruit kabobs. On her way, however, she once again noticed the pretty green ring she had spotted when she was flying. And just like the fruit kabob‚Äôs, the ring was ten cents.

So obviously, Ai just wasted Yurt dime.",1608311404

An English cook is trying to build up his skills as a chef. He's been working for years learning all sorts of rare and unique dishes to serve at his mentor's restaurant.

One day a wealthy guest at the restaurant asks to meet the cook and says ""While I enjoyed the meal good cook I must say that there is something that dissapointed me""
The cook apologised and asked what the issue was
""You see on my travels I had a most delightful dish cooked by a travelling chef but have been unable to find it anywhere else since. I had heard this restaurant dealt in exotic foods and thought I might at last find it on the menu. Alas it seems you do not serve it.""
""What was the dish called?"" asked the cook
""I believe the chef called it poy"" said the guest.
The cook was perplexed, he had never heard of poy before and decided to do some research when he got home.

After a few weeks the cook found nothing on the mysterious poy. He decided that since the guest had found it while travelling that he should do the same. So he asked his chef for a holiday so he could track the dish down and packed his bags.

He began by getting in touch with a friend from cullinary school called Jaques that had opened a resaurant in Paris. When the cook arrived he asked Jaques if he had ever heard of poy.
""Ah! Oui I 'ave indeed 'eard of zis dish, but I only know ze name. I believe it was Monsieur Gino in Italy zat mentioned it ze last time 'e was 'ere.""
The cook was delighted to finally have a lead and sat down to some Jaques' famous garlic snails that evening before setting off the next day.

When the cook arrived in Milan he sought out Gino's countryside restaurant that overlooked a beautiful vinyard. There spoke to the aged Italian chef that introduced himself. After a gorgeous meal and some fine wine the cook asked Gino ""My friend in France said you mentioned a dish called poy on your last visit, what do you know about it?""
The Italian's eyes lit up "" S√≠ my friend s√≠! Many years ago I heard rumours of it in a Thai street market.""
The two of them then sat up all night drinking bottle after bottle of wine discussing the intricacies of cuisine.

The cook woke up severely hungover the next afternoon and caught a plane to Bangkok. Having recovered on the plane he wasted no time in going to street food stands around the city. He asked around, place after place but found very little of use in his search. Just as the cook was about to give up he met a traveller from India eating at one of the stands. The Indian man claimed to be from a village at the foot of the Himilayas. ""I have heard of this poy you are looking for. There are stories told in my village to this day of the wandering chef and his magnificent poy. I will bring you there.""
With that, the cook ate his fill of the variety available in the market and took off with his new companion to the north of India.

Upon arriving in the village the cook was greeted warmly as a guest by the family of the traveller. When the mother learnt he was a cook she grew excited, pressing him for new recipes but keeping hers close to the chest. Eventually after much back and forth the cook was able to ask about poy.
""You like my cooking so I'll tell you. This good for nothing vagrant comes into my home and insults my cooking! Starts talking poy this and poy that! Eats his fill of my food then disappears into the mountains without even saying thank you! When you find him you give him a piece of my mind!""
With that the cook said his thank yous and set about finding a guide for the mountains.

After meeting a Sherpa that agreed to guide him, the cook took off. The trek was hard, day after day soon turned into week after week of climbing. The cook was cold and battered, wondering if it was worth it, wondering if he'd ever find this mysterious poy. He trudged on one step after another until at last a village came into sight. The guide pointed and said ""This where you find poy"". 
The cook was delighted, in spite of his empty stomach and worn out legs he practically ran for the village.

Now that we are halfway through my first term, I think it's time we take a look at some of the great and glorious things I have accomplished in my first two years. We have brought some important visitors here too, fine examples of making America great again. 

Everyone, I want you to meet Steve. Under Obama, Steve was homeless and broke, addicted to drugs, begging for coins on Wall Street. But now, thanks to my beautiful tax cut, Steve gets more than twice as much dimes and quarters on a typical day. More than twice. Can you believe that?

Then here is Mary. She is from Texas and because of Obama, Mary lost her job to Mexican immigrants. For the past six years, instead of working, Mary has spent her days doing nothing but drinking beer and gazing at the desert. Today, thanks to my new Southern Border Wall, which is already almost started to be scheduled for planning, Mary may soon get something new to look at. Isn't that great? 

And last, say hello to John. Under the Obama administration, he was a thief and a fraud, and nobody could do anything about it. The police were weak and helpless. He stole everything he could get his hands on, and as soon as he got out of prison, he was at it again. Nobody in their right mind trusted John to even hold a pair of old shoes.

husband keeps falling asleep during your sermons. It's very
embarrassing. What should I do?""

""I have an idea,"" said the minister. ""Take this hatpin with you.
I will be able to tell when Mr. Jones is sleeping, and I will
motion to you at specific times. When I motion, you give him a
good poke in the leg.""

In church the following Sunday, Mr. Jones dozed off. Noticing
this, the preacher put his plan to work. ""And who made the
ultimate sacrifice for you?"" he said, nodding to Mrs. Jones.

""Jesus!"", Jones cried as his wife jabbed him the leg with the
hatpin.

""Yes, you are right, Mr. Jones,"" said the minister. Soon, Mr.
Jones nodded off again. Again, the minister noticed. ""Who is
your redeemer?"" he asked the congregation, motioning towards
Mrs. Jones.

""God!"" Mr. Jones cried out as he was stuck again with the hatpin.

""Right again,"" said the minister, smiling. Before long, Mr.
Jones again winked off. However, this time the minister did not
notice. As he picked up the tempo of his sermon, he made a few
motions that Mrs. Jones mistook as signals to bayonet her
husband with the hatpin again.

The minister asked, ""And what did Eve say to Adam after she bore
him his 99th son?""

Mrs. Jones poked her husband, who yelled, ""You stick that
goddamned thing in me one more time and I'll break it in half

kfgyqx,Jokes,kgangadhar,Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile...," In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.

One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher‚Äôs snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.

Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! ‚ÄúThank you, young men,‚Äù said the fairy, ‚ÄúYour hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is my friend Set, and you can call me ‚ÄòEp‚Äô‚Äù, said Amenhotep.

‚ÄúVery well, Ep,‚Äù said the fairy ‚ÄúWhat is the desire of your heart?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish I was the strongest man in the world!‚Äù Amenhotep wished.

‚ÄúVery well‚Äù, said the fairy, ‚Äúbut you must always use your strength to help others.‚Äù Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles.

The fairy turned to Set ‚ÄúAnd what is your wish, Set?‚Äù  
Set responded ‚ÄúI never want to be poor again! I wish for money!‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. ‚ÄúGreetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!‚Äù

‚ÄúElmon is an expert in all things money,‚Äù said the fairy, ‚ÄúHe will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.‚Äù

Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now-massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname ‚ÄúImp‚Äù. With Elmon‚Äôs financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.

Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep.

Ep and Set‚Äôs business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping and became more focused on business expansion and the money of the business.

As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the HQ in Cairo to learn the business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.

Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.

Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature‚Äôs effect on Set‚Äôs fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.

Josep was shocked and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon and sent the teenager to jail.

Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.

Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set‚Äôs case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. ‚ÄúCome, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let‚Äôs use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.‚Äù

Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon‚Äôs murder.

The case was brought before the court, but Set‚Äôs claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.

Obviously, Ep‚Äôs teen didn‚Äôt kill Imp‚Äôs elf.",1608278313

They walk to a door and Putin lets him into a room and locks the door behind him. In the room is a two way mirror and three buttons.

Curious, Obama pushes the first button and a giant rubber hand comes out of the wall and slaps him across the face. On the side of the glass the Russians laugh and laugh.

The second button springs a giant boxing mitt that hits Obama in the stomach. On the other side of the glass the Russians can‚Äôt stop laughing.

The third button dumps a bucket of water onto his head and by this time the Russians are almost pissing themselves.

kf5wh6,Jokes,smooleybotcheck,Jews vs Christians.,"To settle the age old tensions between them Christians and Jews decide to have a winner-takes-all contest in Jerusalem. This contest will be fought between the two greatest theologians of their respective religions, and the medium used will be expressive sign language. 

The two parties meet in the old city, out in the open in the city centre, a huge crowd gathers around them, watching in rapt silence. 

A priest and a rabbi leave their respective camps and square off in the middle of the emptied street. 

By coin toss, which the rabbi wins, he elected to graciously allow the priest to go first. 

The priest begins by waving is out stretched hand across the city. 

The rabbi looks flustered and points to the ground. 

The priest, confused raises his hand and holds up three fingers. 

The rabbi, red faced holds up one finger in reply. 

The priest, sweating profusely, his collar undone and clothes soaked brings out an apple. 

The rabbi fumbles with his belongings and brings out a loaf of bread and wine. 

The priest falls to his knees weeping, and is carried away by his colleagues, wailing all the way. 

The rabbi stomps off back his party. 

In the Christian camp there is pandemonium. ‚ÄúWhat happened out there, Father? What did he say?‚Äù Asked an Archbishop. 

‚ÄúFather, the rabbi...he‚Äôs a genius, no matter what I hit him with he had a reply. I can‚Äôt fight him anymore‚Äù 

The Archbishop demands to know what was said. 

‚ÄúAt first. I began with a gesture, signifying that God, in all his majesty is everywhere. But the rabbi reminded me, that God is also present here too‚Äù 

‚ÄúI then held up three fingers. Representing the holy trinity of our Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, once again the rabbi reminded me with his one upheld finger that God is one and all‚Äù 

Then, I brought out an apple, the fruit of the garden of Eden, the symbol of creation itself. But the rabbi... He showed me the bread and the wine.. the body and blood of our lord Jesus Christ. I cannot beat him. He‚Äôs a genius‚Äù 

There is similar confusion in the Jewish camp. 

‚ÄúRabbi! Tell us what happened!‚Äù 

The rabbi is furious; 

‚ÄúTHAT BLOKES A MADMAN!!‚Äù 

‚ÄúFirst he says to me, you Jews, piss off, and I says WERE STAYING RIGHT HERE‚Äù 

‚ÄúThen he says to me, I‚Äôll give you lot three days to clear off. So I says I give you lot one day to piss off and all!‚Äù

kf0c1f,Jokes,Admiral37,On the Mass Pike,"Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 50 dead crows in and around greater Boston recently. There was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. 

A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.

However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 96% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 4% were killed by an impact with a car.

MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.

The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat roadkill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah!!"", not a single one could shout ""Truck.""",1608221688

Once there lived a landlord in a village.He was rich. He had a daughter which meant the world to him. One day while he was on his way to work, he heard the news that his daughter fell inside a well, while she was playing. He immediately rushed to the spot and started yelling for help. No one had the courage to jump down the well and rescue her. It was a long well. He went frenzy. But one man in his mid 30s jumped in. Seeing this everyone started helping him and they managed to pull out the man and the landlord's daughter. The landlord was overwhelmed. He was so happy that he decided to express his gratitude to this man by arranging a party for the whole village, in order to celebrate this man. He even invited the nearby villages for the party. So on the day of the party, the whole village turned up. It was like a festival which was super lit, except for this man who was sad, melancholy and lost in some deep thought. The landlord said to him 'Oh my dear brother, when no one had the courage to jump into that dangerous well, you did, just to save my daughter, who means the world to me. I arranged this huge party to celebrate your brave act. But why are you upset? Do you want gold? A land? A car? A house? Spit out whatever your mind is yearning for'. That man who hadn't opened his mouth since the incident replied with a dull tone 'I don't want any gifts. I just have one doubt. Can you clarify it for me?'. The landlord was surprised. 'Oh,  I didn't expect this. Well, what is it?' the landlord asked. The man asked with curiosity, ' who pushed me into the well?'

As he leaves the lobby the friendly desk clerk says ‚ÄúY‚Äôall have a good night!!‚Äù

He gets to his room and try as he might, he can‚Äôt get to sleep because of a maddening drip sound coming from the bathroom. He gets up to investigate and finds that the tap won‚Äôt close completely. After trying his best, he realizes that no amount of force will stop the drip. He calls the local yokel at the front desk.

keoe6p,Jokes,confusedAbtLoveToday,The Trids and the Rabbi,"Once there was a rabbi who was a happy hermit living by himself in some hills far away from anyone else. It wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt like people, he just found that being alone was satisfying.

Every day, the rabbi would walk through the woods in the hills. So familiar with the woods was he that he knew every rock, every tree, each flower, and even named the bees and the birds. It was a good life.

This is why that is was such a surprise to the rabbi when one day, which happened to be his cake day, he saw a half-dozen short, stocky little creatures hiding in some undergrowth. Their eyes locked, and the creatures jumped up from their position. The rabbi was stunned by their appearance.

Their skin was gray, mottled with tan splotches. Yellow eyes stared right through him from beneath the hood of their brown cloaks. Though they were short, their fingers were long and slender.

They spoke excitedly to each other in high-pitch voices in a language the rabbi had never heard. They pointed vigorously in his direction, watching him intently all the while. Finally, they completed their huddle and one of the creatures stepped forward, raising a hand in greeting.

‚ÄúFair day to you, human,‚Äù said the creature. ‚ÄúWe are trids. No human has ever seen us before, and we aren‚Äôt sure what we should do with you, but our wise and great king will know. You will come with us.‚Äù

The rabbi, not sensing that there was really any danger, agreed to go with them.

So through the hills the seven went, walking for miles, farther than the rabbi usually went on his own. They came to a small cave opening. The trids motioned for him to follow them.

The cave was lit with luminous rocks, and the rabbi watched them glow with wonder. The cave floors were rocky, though passable without too much difficulty. The biggest problem for the rabbi was that the ceilings were a bit low for his taste, and he bumped his head a time or two. After a short journey (perhaps a long one as far as his back was concerned), the tunnels let out into a grand hall. 

It may have been the most amazing sight of his life. 

It was so large, the rabbi wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised if the entire hill was hallowed out. In the center of this grand hall was a circular, raised platform of carefully carved stones, perhaps 40‚Äô tall. A double helix of a staircase and what appeared to be a slide of some kind encircled the platform. 

On top was a large throne, where a much larger trid sat comfortably, his back to the rabbi. A long line of trids led up to the king. His traveling companions got in line, and the rabbi followed protocol.

After being in line for some time, the rabbi finally figured out what was happening. The trids were taking the staircase up to see the king. After a bow and a brief exchange of words, the trids would turn around, bend over, and with a swift, hard kick, the king would send them tumbling down the slide. The rabbi thought this quite strange, but didn‚Äôt want to embarrass his companions or make a scene.

Eventually, it was the rabbi‚Äôs turn. He looked at the king, bowed, offered what he hoped was a polite greeting, and then turned around and bent over, ready for the kick. Instead of kicking him, the king tapped him on the shoulder and said, ‚Äúsilly rabbi, kicks are for trids!‚Äù",1608172719

keo7cz,Jokes,rednecklover420,The lion‚Äôs birthday is coming up and he wants entertainment.,"So he tells the zebra to find the funniest animal in the whole kingdom. In order to do this the zebra decides to hold a competition in which animals will have to compete in front of a judge. Whoever the first one to makemake the judge laugh wins and will perform for the lion.

So the first thing the zebra does is look for the most serious animal. He walks up to a tortoise and asks, ‚ÄúHey tortoise, I‚Äôm holding a competition and all you have to do is sit there and laugh if you find an animal to be funny. Will you do it?‚Äù  The tortoise responds, ‚Äú...Yes.‚Äù

The day of the competition arrives and all The animals have gathered to compete. Since this is for the lion, the zebra decides to raise the stakes to ensure every animal delivers their full potential. He says, ‚ÄúAnimals, your goal is to make the tortoise laugh. If you are able to do so, you win and get to perform for the lion. If you fail to make the tortoise laugh, then you will be killed and become the lion‚Äôs meal.‚Äù

The competition begins and up first is the monkey. He jumps from tree to tree, does flips, and makes funny noises. The zebra becomes pleased and looks at the tortoise and asks what he thinks, to which the tortoise says, ‚Äú...‚Äù Since there is no reaction from the judge, the monkey is killed.

Up next is the ostrich. He runs around in circles and is moving his long neck. He jumps and does funny moves. The zebra is once again pleased and turns to see the reaction of the tortoise, which once again is, ‚Äú...‚Äù So there‚Äôs nothing the zebra can do and they have the ostrich killed.

This pattern goes on with many of the funniest animals and the zebra becomes worried that they won‚Äôt have someone for the lion‚Äôs party. All of a sudden the next animal approaches, the hippopotamus. The zebra knows that he won‚Äôt be able to perform any fun tricks and just as he‚Äôs about to have him killed, he hears a chuckle from the tortoise. That chuckle turns into full blown roars of laughter. The zebra is bewildered and asks the tortoise, ‚ÄúHey what‚Äôs so funny? He hasn‚Äôt done anything! He is literally just standing there!‚Äù 

The tortoise responds, ‚ÄúHAHA, wow that monkey was hilarious!‚Äù",1608172073

""Why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?"" his wife said.

So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.

*This is the biggest day of my daughter's life, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake*, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.

*How quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's wedding.

He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.

""Hello,"" the father asked, ""I would like to buy a cake.""

""Of course,"" the monk replied, ""just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk.""

The father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.

The day of the wedding arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. All of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.

The monk was offered a seat at one of the wedding tables and garnered a lot of attention. At the end of the wedding, the father approached the monk and asked,

""Why do you do this for free? You should take money for your services!""

The monk smiled and said, ""I do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma.""",1608171536

Anyone who could squeeze even one more drop out of the lemon would win the money.Over the years many people had tried this, truck drivers, weightlifters and all had failed. Then one day this frail little fella with heavy rimmed spectacles came into the bar and asked if he could try the challenge.After the laughter had subsided the owner said that it was only fair that the man be given a chance at the bet, so he picked up a lemon and started squeezing. Once he was done he handed the remains to the little man who promptly squeezed out 4 more drops of juice onto the bar.Everyone looked on in amazement as the owner handed over the prize and asked, ""What do you do for a living that has given you such strength? Are you a lumberjack, weightlifter, what?""""No"" the man replied, ""I work for the IRS.""",1608144567

""You have so much to live for,"" said the man. ""I'm a sailor, and we are off to Italy tomorrow. I can stow you away on my ship. I'll take care of you, bring you food every day, and keep you happy.""

With nothing to lose, combined with the fact that she had always wanted to go to Italy, the woman accepted.

That night, the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold. From then on, every night he would bring her sandwiches, a bottle of red wine, and make love to her until dawn. Three weeks later she was discovered by the Captain during a routine inspection.

""What are you doing here?"" asked the Captain.

""I have an arrangement with one of the sailors,"" she replied. ""He brings me food and I get a free trip to Italy .""

""I see,"" the Captain said.  ""Anything else?""

Her conscience got the best of her and she added, with some embarrassment, ""Plus, he's screwing me.""

So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay
That's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep-throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes
But sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said
On ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line
Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel
With fucking cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
While he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music
You make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do
When they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop.""
'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Unghh, school flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
When I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still ""Chunky, but Funky""
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and
Here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons
Make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king?
Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

It was getting crowded in Heaven one day, so Saint Peter decided to only accept people who could make him laugh.

A man came walking up to the gates and Saint Peter said to him:

""Alright bud, you're only getting in today if you can make me laugh, so why don't you tell me about how you died""

The man looked at Saint Peter and said ""Oh man it was awful, I was absolutely SURE my wife was having an affair, so I left work early and came home to catch her in the act! When I got home, sure as shit there she was naked in bed!! looked all over the apartment but I couldn't find the guy anywhere so I went out onto the balcony, we live on the 25th floor, and there he was! Hanging over the edge by his fingertips! I ran inside, grabbed a hammer, and started smacking his hands and fingers with it! He finally let go and fell down 25 stories but he landed in some bushes, so I ran inside and grabbed the refrigerator and heaved it over the balcony down on top of him, crushing him and killing him! But the strain and exertion from picking up the refrigerator gave me a heart attack and I died."" 

Saint Peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let this poor soul in.

Another man came walking up to the gates and Saint Peter told this man the same thing, that in order to get in he had to make St. Peter laugh. The second guy told him about how he died.

""Well St. Peter, it was awful, I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th story apartment when a flock of birds came out of nowhere and startled me! I fell over the railing but managed to grab the balcony of the apartment below me. All of a sudden, some maniac came outside and started hitting my hands with a hammer until I let go! Luckily, I landed in some bushes but then this guy dropped a freaking refrigerator on me!‚Äù

Saint Peter chuckled again, let the second man into heaven, and decided he could really start to enjoy his job. A third man came walking up to the pearly gates.

Saint Peter gave his speech to this third man and then told him:

""Tell me about the day you died

""Oh man Saint Peter you're never gonna believe this! Alright so picture this...I'm butt naked hiding in a refrigerator.""",1608125657

His closest neighbor is several miles away, but he does catch a glimpse of him from afar once in a while, when the neighbor is out hunting or gathering firewood.

At first everything is great; he really enjoys the isolation, and gets a ton of work done. . . but after a few months, he starts to really crave some company. He goes outside one day and spots his neighbor off in the distance, and waves both arms at him to attract his attention. Sure enough, the neighbor notices and waves back.

Opening the door, he sees that his neighbor is a huge muscular bear-giant of a man, with arms and legs like tree trunks, and an enormous beard. They introduce themselves; the man doesn't seem accustomed to speaking to people, and is rather gruff and terse in his speech.

""Wow, it's great to meet you,"" says the writer. ""I've been getting a little lonely up here all by myself.""

Paul, who weighs 600 pounds walks into a doctor`s office.

This doctor is known for his unorthodox methods of treatment. He uses unusual but effective methods. Paul is desperate and thinks that this doctor is the only one who can help him.

Paul says, ""Doctor you must help me. I have tried everything. I have done dieting, exercise, innumerable pills, detox, everything!  I just cannot seem to lose this weight.""

The doctor hesitates for a minute. He finally looks up and says, ""The only thing I can do is to sew your mouth shut and teach you to eat from your butt.""

Paul hesitantly agrees. He returns one week later to have the procedure. Two weeks pass and Paul returns to have the stitches out.

The doctor says, ""Now return to me in 3 months for a post-op checkup.""

Paul astonishingly loses 200 pounds.  He is extremely handsome now. He even has six-packs. 

Three months later, Paul returns for his post-op checkup. As he sits down in the chair, the doctor notices that Paul is twitching his butt up and down.

 He lets it go and continues his examination. After one hour of watching Paul twitch his butt, the doctor can`t take it anymore.
 
He finally says, ""I'm sorry Paul. I have concluded that you have a nervous tick in your butt as a result of your operation.""

2 friends John and George go to the movies in order to watch a **WWII** movie.

at beginning of the movie, john had the urge to fart but he couldn't do so, since he was in a theater full of people and they would hear him....

so he waited for the perfect moment .... and when in the movie, there was a battle and the loud machine guns were firing he started farting without being noticed at all.

Later on, he wanted to fart again so he again waited for the right moment.... and when the soldiers were throwing grenades he farted without being noticed yet again.

Near the end of the movie, his urge to fart came back, but this time it was way bigger...so he waits for the right moment for quite a bit, until there is a scene where the Germans were about to blow up an entire train... the noise of this scene was SO loud that it covered the sound of the too extremely loud fart of Jhon's.

In the meantime his friend George who was asleep, woke up but the loud sound of the train exploding and asks his friend John what happened.

""the Germans blew up the whole train"" said John .

Thank you for calling Technical Support. All of our technicians are currently busy helping people even less competent than you, so please hold for the next available technician. The waiting time is now estimated at between fifteen minutes and eternity. 

In order to expedite your call, please punch your 63-digit product identification number onto your telephone touch pad, followed by your product serial number, which can be found in a secret compartment inside your computer where, for security purposes, it is printed in the smallest typeface known to mankind. Do that now.

(Lengthy excerpt from Mahler's ""Lugubrious"" Symphony in C Minor)

Thank you again for calling Technical Support. We recommend that you sit at your computer, preferably turning it on at some point, and have at hand all your floppy disks, CD-ROM disks, computer manuals and original packing materials in order to allow the technician to aid you in the unlikely event that he ever takes your call. It would also be helpful for you to refrain from sobbing while explaining your problem to the technician. Shouting obscene threats will cause you to be immediately disconnected and blackballed from further communication with Technical Support, not only from ours but that of every other electronics-related firm in the industrialized world.

(Medley of Hootie and the Blowfish hits rendered by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir)

Thank you once again for calling Technical Support. In order to enable us to better assist you, it would be helpful to know more about you and your equipment. Have you called Technical Support before? If you have, please press the numeral ""one"" on your telephone touchpad. If not, press the numeral ""two."" If you are not sure, using the letters on your touchpad, spell out the phrase: ""I am confused and despondent and quickly losing the will to live."" Once you have finished, hang up your phone and make arrangements to sell your computer because by the time the technician takes your call, it will be obsolete, and you will be too senile to use it anyway.

Thank you for calling Technical Support. Unfortunately, all of our technicians just went out for lunch. This means that to the estimated waiting time we gave you earlier, you may now add at least another two hours.

(Wayne Newton singing ""Danke Schoen"" 1,743 times)

Thank you for calling Technical Support. Before talking to the technician about your problem and risking the possibility that you may be wasting his valuable time, please ask yourself the following questions: If my monitor screen is dark, is it possible I have forgotten to plug in my computer or, alternately, that I have been suddenly struck blind? Have I exhausted every possible means of help before utilizing the sacred, last-resort-only telephone option? Have I sent a fax to Fast Fax Technical Support? Have I consulted my manual? Have I read the Read-Me notice on the floppy disk? Have I called up my know-it-all geek cousin who I can't stand but who can probably fix this thing for me in under five minutes? Have I given the central processing unit of my computer a good, solid whack? If you can not honestly answer ""yes"" to all these questions, please get off the line immediately so that our overworked technicians can help those truly desperate customers whose suffering is so much greater than yours.

(Recording of Tibetan monks performing a six-day chant celebrating the reincarnation of one of their recently deceased colleagues into the form of a salamander.)

Thank you for calling Technical Support. You may not be aware that this week we are featuring a discount on a number of popular CD-ROM titles you may wish to purchase.  If you would like to hear all 26,000 titles read to you, shout ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" into the telephone now. This will not cause you to lose your place in line for Technical Support; in fact it may jump you ahead of several other callers.

Before doing so, please take a moment to place your telephone receiver back in its base and switch off your computer so as not to wear down its internal battery. As a non-living person, you will have no further need of Technical Support and so we regretfully must remove you from our list of registered product users.

kd6uee,Jokes,Jinno69,Four rings,"So, a man wakes up in a dingy slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused. ""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend. The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",1607980832

After a short time, a smile came to her face and she answered proudly, explaining that she had first married a banker when she was in her 20's, then a circus ringmaster when in her 40's, and a preacher when in her 60's, and now - in her 80's - a funeral director.

The doctors tried to reassure him that prosthetic devices had come a long way in recent years, and he would be able to live normally with an artificial one.  They sent him to the best prosthetic store in town.

He arrived at the store and explained his situation.  The salesman said he had just the thing and went into the back.  He returned with a box and opens it to reveal a penis that was remarkably similar to the one Dan used to to have.  Dan said ""It's perfect, I'll take it.

When my older son started school, we would walk home together and discuss what he'd learned and talk about life.  He was (and still is, many years later) an earnest chap with a real curiosity for the world around him.  And I became used to having to answer quite obscure questions about science and society.

So I wasn't too surprised when, one day as we walked home, after a few moments when he looked really deep in thought, he asked me:

""Daddy, what's a soul?""

Now, I want both yesterday.  I know a parent-trap when I see one, so I said:

""Well, it depends on how you spell it.  If you spell it one way, it can mean the bottom of your foot, or a type of fish.  But if you spell it another way, it's what people call the bit of you that some people think lives for ever.""

He took all of this in and looked like there was some important issue still nagging at him.  I could tell there was more to come and I waited patiently, as we walked along, with all the wisdom of the grown-up that I could muster.

And sure enough, eventually, he opened his mouth to ask the question that was really eating at him:

""So, Daddy,' he said, ""what's an ar-soul?""

""It's very simple,"" she assured her nervous boy. ""When you board the bus tomorrow morning, tell the conductor, 'Sir, I want to go to Maple Avenue.'""

So the next day, little Timmy boarded the bus and said to the conductor, ""S-s-s-sir, I want t-t-t-to go to Map-p-p-le Avenue."" To his astonishment, the conductor clipped his ear before signalling the driver to move off. The day after that, he thought he'd try again. When the bus arrived, he said to the conductor, ""Sir, t-t-t-t-take me to Map-p-p-,"" and the conductor clipped his ear again. 

When it happened yet again, Timmy told his mother about it, and she decided to have it out with the conductor. Accordingly, the next day, the bus arrived and there was the same person. Timmy's mother angrily marched up onto the bus and demanded of the conductor, ""Why do you keep hitting my son?"" 

The conductor flushed with anger, pointed at Timmy and retorted, ""B-b-b-brat k-k-keeps mock-k-k-king me!""",1607917291

""Don't worry about it, you lived a good life. Come on in.""

So the comedian enters heaven and walks around. It's all that he heard about and more: angels, harps, fluffy clouds, an open bar, the works. But the angels and seraphim and the whole lot realize that the comedian walks with a downcast, humorless look. After some time, God gets word of the comedian's apparent misery and goes to him. God says,

""What's troubling you, my son?""

""Oh, I don't know. In life I devoted myself to laughter, to jokes. Seems like I just don't have the heart for it anymore.""

""Is that all? No worries, my son, I know all the greatest jokes in Creation."" And so God tells the comedian one joke after the other--clean jokes, dirty jokes, surreal jokes, skits, bits, and everything else. All throughout, the comedian just nods, unable to do more than politely smile. Eventually God, frustrated that he cannot make this man laugh, says, ""Well, why don't you tell me one?""

So the Jewish man tells a joke only he and others who have experienced the concentration camps would know. Now it is God who cannot laugh, but only smiles with tremendous sadness in His eyes. The comedian shrugs and says,

""Eh, I guess you had to have been there.""",1607911066

He went to his local sex shop, and talked to the person behind the counter. He explained his situation, and then asked: ""I need something really amazing for my wife. All I see here are normal toys. Do you have anything in the back that will REALLY knock her socks off?""

""Well sir, there's the voodoo dick, but I don't want to sell you THAT. It's too powerful"" replied the clerk.

""Please! That sounds exactly like what my wife needs!"" said the man.

The salesclerk took him into a room and pulled out a box. They opened it, and inside was something that looked like a normal dildo.

""That doesn't look like anything special... what does it do?"" He asked.

The clerk gave the man a wink. ""Check this out. Voodoo dick, THE DOOR."" The toy jumped out of the box and began to thrust itself against the door.

""Voodoo Dick, THE CEILING!"" the clerk shouted. Like magic, the dildo shot towards the ceiling and began pumping away.

""I'll take it!"" The man was so happy. The clerk put the toy back in the box and wrapped it up. 

So the man took the Voodoo Dick back home to his wife and showed her how to use it. Then, he left for his next trip.

The wife, with her husband away, took out the voodoo dick and said ""voodoo dick... my pussy!"" 

It was the best toy she had ever had. She kept at it for hours. 

Finally, she wanted it to stop. Unfortunately, every time she pulled it out, it just lept back in and started again. She decided to go to the sex shop to see if the clerk could tell her how to turn if off.

While she was driving, the Voodoo Dick started making her come. Her arms and legs were shaky, so she started swerving, and a cop pulled her over.

When the cop came to her window, she was frantic. ""SomyhusbandgotmethevoodoodickandIcan'tgetitoutsoIwantedtogobacktotheshopbutIstartedtohaveanorgasmandIwasshakingandthatswhyIwasswervingandIcan'tgetittostopit'sstillgoingnow..."" she blurted as the toy was still going to town.

kcn4ub,Jokes,Da_Chicken303,"Jack, Jill, Mike and Rob were in the finals of a world-renowned cooking competition.","Today, the objective was simple. You had two hours to create any dish, as long as it is as indicative of a country's culture as possible. All four of them had thought long beforehand, and were ready to take on the challenge.

Soon, food was simmering, rice was boiling and pots and pans were clattering. The judges were eager to try their food, after all they've literally made it to the finals.

After two hours of intense cookery, the chefs were ready. Their food plated, and put on a table for the judges to test.

Starting off, Jack made a plate of pasta. The sauce was warm and inviting, and it's aroma filling the air. Judge #1 took a single bite, and said, ""This Italian food is absolutely perfect! The pasta is cooked without fail, and it tastes far better than anything else I've ever had! 10/10!""

Then, the judges went to Jill's dish. On it, was an enormous steak. It sizzled with heat and was spicy and juicy. Judge #2 looked at it, and proudly announced, ""Large portion size, meat... this is clearly American food! Don't mind if I take a bite!"" He put a slice of steak in his mouth, and his eyes lit up. ""Oh my word, this is absolutely heavenly! Top notch cooking, Jill! You've exceeded my expectations! 10/10!""

Afterwards, it was Mike's turn. He presented eight steamed buns, resting inside of a bamboo casing. A puff of steam greeted the judges when the lid was raised. Judge #3 piped up. ""Clearly this is Chinese food! I'd love to have a taste of my homeland!"" With that, he picked one up and shoved it in his mouth. ""Âé≤ÂÆ≥ÔºÅ (Amazing!) This is the best I've ever had (sorry mom)! The prawns and the bun is so good, I want to eat all of it! 10/10!""

Finally, it was Rob's turn. Everyone knew that Rob was the most creative, and was always pleasing the judges. So it must have been surprised when he took the lid off his plate and revealed...

Nothing. 

Not a single grain of rice, or a single vegetable or a single cube of meat. It was completely empty.

Before the judges could utter a word, Rob said, ""Hey judges. I've made African food.""

At the riverbank, the lizard is so stoned that he leans over too far and falls in. A crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to the side. 

He then asks the lizard ""What's the matter with you!?"" The lizard explains that he was up in the tree, smoking a joint with the monkey and his mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a drink from the river, he fell in!

The inquisitive crocodile says he has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint.

Nietzsche was taken aback by this. ""Don't do it Plato!"" he begged, ""When you gaze long into the abyss also gazes back into you. Surely you'll be confronted with emptiness so profoundly that you'll be eternally haunted by it!""

In fact, he got assigned to these cases so much that he had gotten pretty good at resolving these situations in a way where everyone left happy, but Riley found these cases really boring. Still, he finished his doughnut, took a sip of his coffee, and began to make his way to the store.

He got to the store pretty quickly. The cop cars outside let him know he was in the right place. As he pulled up, he made eye contact with Officer Patrick, and he promptly got out of his car to meet him. After a quick greeting Patrick began to explain the situation. ""An english woman and a black woman got into a fight but the women involved are either too distraught or angry to talk to us,"" Officer Patrick explained. He didn't need to say anything more. Riley looked towards the entrance of the Victoria's Secret and immediately saw the two ladies in question. One of them was sitting on the sidewalk holding her head, and a few feet away from her was the other woman still very clearly upset.

Riley decided that the woman on the sidewalk needed his help first as he was confident she lost the fight. He approached her and introduced himself and told her that he needed to know what happened. After some poking and proding she finally began to talk. ""I was just talking on the phone and that lady over just came up to me and started screaming at the top of her lungs,"" the english woman said. ""Surely there was more to it than that,"" Riley said, ""Can you recall saying anything on the phone that may have set her off?"" She swore up and down that she was just having a regular conversation with a friend, and she didn't say anything that could've offended anyone.

Now that he got one side of the story it was time to talk to the other woman. Riley made his way past the officers trying to calm her down, and introduced himself as he did with the english woman. Luckily the other officers seemed to have calmed down a bit since he got there. She admitted to beating up the other woman with just a single ask, but now he needed to know why. ""Why'd you do it?""

kca6i5,Jokes,coffee-mutt,A lawyer wins his first truly huge case with a multi-million dollar payoff.,"He's flying high.  He drives to the office the next Monday in shiny new threads with all of the most expensive trimming, driving the most expensive imported Bentley he can find.  Everyone at the office needs to see this, he thinks, so he gets there super early to park right in front of the building, right on the street.

As he opens the door to get out of his Bentley, so new that he is still finding plastic stickers inside, a passing car speeds by, smashes into the door, and rips it right off.  That driver never slows down, and speeds away.

The lawyer is beyond furious.  He calls the police and demands they come that second so they can find and arrest this heinous person who ruined his new Bentley in a criminal hit and run.

The officer arrives very quickly.  He goes up to the lawyer, who is still in his car yelling and screaming at someone on the phone.  The officer says a horrified, ""oh my god.""

The lawyer hears him, drops his call, and says, ""I know!  The door is ripped clean off!  The whole car is ruined!  Even if they fix it, it will never be the same!""

Then the officer frowns at the lawyer and starts to shake his head.

The lawyer starts going on and on about how much money he just lost, how expensive the Bentley was, how tragic and how evil the driver of the other car had to be.

The cop finally interrupts, ""you lawyers.  You are all the same.""

Suddenly, the lawyer's anger turns to the cop.  What?  How dare you!  Can't you see that this beautiful machine is destroyed?  You are a protector of the city!  You should be out arresting this criminal, not insulting me sitting here!  This reckless menace cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars!  This was a brand new Bentley!

The cop interrupts again, ""I get it.  You've been talking about your car.  It was expensive, you lost a lot of money.  But in this whole time, you never realized that he also tore your whole left arm off.""

The lawyer is stunned into silence.  He looks down at where his arm should be.  Horror and pain cross his face.

After sitting on the couch for about a year he suddenly decides that he wants to be a chef. So he searches and finds a few restaurants that are looking for chefs. He goes to the first restaurant and walks up to the owner. 
""I hear that you need chefs, I'd like to be a chef."" 
The owner says ""Great! Do you have any experience?"" 
The man shakes his head ""No, but I'm willing to learn!"" 
The owner frowns. ""I'm sorry but I'm only looking for experienced chefs, I'm afraid I can't hire you."" Undeterred thr man goes to the next restaurant on his list. ""I hear that you need chefs, I'd like to be a chef."" He says again. Once more the owner replies ""Great! Do you have any experience?""
 The man shakes his head, a little exasperated. ""No, but I'm willing to learn!"" 
The owner smiles politely. ""I'm sorry but I'm only looking for experienced chefs, I'm afraid I can't hire you."" 
The man walks off and goes to the next restaurant on his list, determined to get the job this time. ""I hear that you're hiring chefs, I'd like to be a chef."" 
The owner looks at him. ""Great! Do you have any experience."" 
The man sighs ""No, but I am willing to learn."" 
The owner shakes his head. ""I'm sorry but I'm only looking for experienced chefs, I'm afraid I can't hire you."" 
The man jumps up exasperated. ""This is ridiculous! No one is willing to hire a chef with no experience! But how am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me?"" 
The restaurant owner nods his head. ""I understand your frustration"" he says, in a voice cultivated by years of customer service and placating entitled and angry diners, ""you know, if you join the military they'll train you in a skill, you might be able to become a chef that way."" 
The man stops. ""That...might work. Thank you!""

So the man goes down to the Naval recruitment center and marches up to the recruiter. ""I want to join the Navy!"" He says. 
""GREAT!"" Says the recruiter. ""Do you have any skills?""
""No, but I want to learn to be a chef!""
""The navy doesn't really need chefs,"" the recruiter explains with a bit of resentment of the truth of the statement in his tone, ""but we always need more Sailors, do you want to be a sailor?""
""I don't want to be a sailor I want to be a chef!"" And he storms out, next he goes to the Air Force recruitment center and marches up to the recruiter. ""I want to join the Air Force!"" He says.
""GREAT!"" Says the recruiter. ""Do you have any skills?""
""No, but I want to learn to be a chef!""
""The Air Force doesn't really need any more chefs,"" he explains, ""but we always need more pilots, do you want to be a pilot?""
""I don't want to be a pilot I want to be a chef!"" And he storms out and goes to the marine recruitment center.
""I want to join the marines!"" He says.
""OF F*****G COURSE YOU DO SEMPER FI!"" The recruiter shouts with all the enthusiasm of a Labrador retriever that has just encountered a stranger, ""YOU GOT ANY NEW SKILLS TO BRING TO THE MARINES?""
""Well, no...but I want to learn to be a chef?""
""WHY THE F**K WOULD YOU WANT TO BE A CHEF? THIS IS THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS WE HAVE NO F*****G NEED FOR G*****N CHEFS! YOU CAME HERE TO BE A MARINE AND YOU'RE GONNA BE THE BEST G*****N MARINE YOU CAN BE!""
""I don't want to be a marine I want..."" and is promptly thrown out of the recruitment office. So he goes down to the Army recruitment center. As he's walking through the doors he realizes that if he says he has no skills then he's not going to get into where he wants. He walks up to the recruiter.
""I'd like to join the Army!"" He says.
""Great!"" Says the recruiter, ""Do you have any skills?""
""Yes!"" He lies. ""I'm a gloopmaker!""
""I'm sorry you're a what?""
""I'm a gloopmaker.""
The recruiter pauses, ""What's a gloopmaker?""
""A gloopmaker? It's someone who makes gloops!""
""No, I get that, I mean, what's a gloop?""
The man just laughs, ""hahaha, what's a gloop? Good one!""
The recruiter pauses ""Okay...uh I don't think we need a gloopmaker is there anything you want to do?""
""Well I've always wanted to be a chef.""
""Okay! We can do that just go aheadand sign here. So the man goes off to basic, and is then sent to the culinary division to peel potatoes and learn to be a chef. Meanwhile off in the dark bowels of the Pentagon some desk jockey is manually copying over enlistment papers in triplicate because the government has to justify making all those little blue pens that say ""This pen property of the Federal Government"" and filing them when he comes across our man's form with the words ""Occupation: Gloopmaker"" written on it. He stares for a bit then turns to his supervisor.
""Sir, what's a gloopmaker?""
""A gloopmaker? What the hell kind of question is that! Obviously it's someone who makes gloops!""
""No sir, I figured that. I mean, what's a gloop?""
""Well a gloop is a...a gloop is...a gloop...why do you need to know?""
""Well I've got this guy in the Army who listed his occupation as 'gloopmaker' and I'm trying to figure out what a gloop is so I know if we really need him in Culinary.""
""Look! I have better things to do than explain what a gloop is to you! Go requisition a gloop! Then you'll know what one is!""
""Yes sir!"" And the desk jockey runs off to supply. He gets there and calls over the Quartermaster.
""I need to requisition a gloop.""
The Quartermaster looks at him in confusion. ""I'm sorry?""
""I need to requisition a gloop.""
""What's the item number?""
""I don't know.""
""Check the catalogue and give me the number."" So the desk jockey flips through the catalogue 5 times but cannot find a gloop. ""I can't find it!""
""What do you mean you can't find it?""
""I mean I can't find any gloops in the catalogue!""
""LET ME SEE THAT!"" And the quartermaster snatches the catalogue out of the desk jockey's hands and begins flipping through it.
""Looks like we don't have any...why does personell need a gloop anyways?""
""Well we have a gloopmaker in the Army and I didn't know what a gloop was so...""
""Wait wait wait!"" The quartermaster interrupts. ""We have a gloopmaker but we don't have any gloops? This is ridiculous! I gotta take this up with my XO give me his personnel file!"" So the quartermaster goes off to his Executive Officer's office and requests permission to enter.
""Sir we have an issue.""
""What's wrong.""
""Sir we have a gloopmaker in the army but we don't have any gloops.""
""We don't have any what?""
""Gloops sir. We don't have any gloops.""
""But we have a gloopmaker?""
""Yes sir here's his file.""
The XO sighs ""I need to take this up with the General of the Army."" So the XO goes off to the 5 star general of the army.
""Sir we have a problem.""
""What's the problem?""
""We're out of gloops.""
""I'm sorry?""
""We're out of gloops. We have a gloopmaker but for some reason he's in Culinary.""
""What IDIOT put a gloopmaker in Culinary when we don't have any gloops? I need to take this up with the President!""
So the general goes off to the white house and goes to the Oval Office.
""Mr. President we have a problem, it's a matter of national security.""
The president looks up at the General. ""What's the problem General.""
""Mr. President I'm afraid we have no gloops.""
""What do you mean we have no gloops? We are the finest army in the world the Strongest Nation on Earth! How are we supposed to protect and defend American Freedoms without any gloops?""
""Don't worry Mr. President I have a solution I have a gloopmaker.""
""We have a gloopmaker but no gloops? Fix this now and GET ME MY GLOOPS!""
""Yes sir Mr. President!""

Meanwhile back at an army base our poor guy is sitting in the kitchen peeling potatoes blissfully unaware of what is about to happen when the kitchen goes silent, he looks up and notices everyone at attention because the 5 star general just walked in.
""I understand you're a gloopmaker?"" The general asks him.
""Uh...yes sir...""
""Good. The president needs you to make a gloop.""
The guy is now thinking ""Oh shit! They're going to figure out I lied! I'm gonna get thrown out of the military and court marshalled and thrown in Federal prison for committing purjury!"" But he quickly composes himself.
""Well sir, it requires some very specialized and expensive materials""
The general shakes his head. ""Money is no issue. Time is no issue. You tell me what you need and we'll get it."" 
The man just blurts out ""I need moon rocks! At least a Ton! From the Dark Side of the Moon!""
So several Million dollare later NASA sends another rocket to the moon, collects a bunch of moon rocks and brings them back to Earth. The General returns to the Army base.
""Specialist Smith!"" The General yells out.
""Erm, I'm a Private sir.""
""Not anymore, you've been promoted. We have your moon rocks. Can you make us our gloop?""
""Not yet sir! I need Heavy water! At least 50 gallons of it! From the bottom of the Marianas trench!"" Meanwhile he's thinking ""they HAVE to say no, this is too ridiculous. It's impossible!"" The General of the Army just smiles.
""Money is no issue time is no issue. We'll get you your heavy water.""
So several billion dollars later NOAA makes a rover that goes down to the bottom of the Marianas trench, sucks up the water, filters out the water with no Deuterium and successfully gathers up the water. The General goes back to the Army base.
""Sergeant Smith!""
""I'm a specialist sir!""
""Not anymore, you've been promoted! We have your heavy water. Can you make us our gloop?""
""Not yet sir, I need one more thing. A diamond! Clear! Flawless! Cut! At least 4000 carats!"" At this point he's thinking ""This HAS to get them to stop it! This is impossible, it doesn't exist!"" The general nods solemnly. ""Money is no issue, time is no issue. We'll get you your diamond.""
So the US goes to war with South Africa on flimsy pretenses. Trillions of dollars are spent, hundreds of thousands of lives are lost, but eventually, someohow they find the diamond. The General of the Army returns to our man.
""Sergeant Major Smith!""
""It's just Sergeant Smith sir!""
""Not anymore, you've been promoted. We have your diamond. Now make us our gloop!""
So the gloopmaker is taken to a top secret military base in an undisclosed location somewhere in New Mexico (About 6 miles outside of San Mateo, just get off I 40 at exit 72 and follow route 606, Ask for Gerry at the Stop-n-shop he can give you more detailed directions) where he's locked up with some scientists. For three weeks there's a lot of banging and scraping before our man comes out ""Tell the President we have our gloop!""
Five days later on an Aircraft Carrier in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean there is our man on with the President, the Joint Chief of Staff, Congress, and more brass than a firing range the last week before recertification exams. He salutes the President then turns and pulls a sheet off a large object revealing a five foot by five foot by five foot hollow metal cube with a hole in the top. A crane picks up the cube, swings it out over the edge of the ship and drops it into the water where it slowly sinks, air bubbling out of it.

GLOOP!

GLOOP!

GLOOP!

GLOOP!

GLOOP!

Silence reigns on the vessel for 15 seconds before the President speaks.

kc18u5,Jokes,MGTwyne,"Once upon a time, somewhere far far away, there was a mailman.","And this mailman was suspected of mail tampering, forgery, and all this other stuff. You see, he'd been delivering letters for 50 years-and yet, half the time, the original packages and letters would never arrive. Instead, they'd be replaced with exact duplicates, but for the presence of the mail man's name in place of the recipients.


One day, one guy (a detective) gets it in his head to follow the mailman home-he dissapears every afternoon, and nobody knows where he's going. So, the guy straps his hiking boots on and follows.


First, the mailman stops by the post office to drop off his cap and his uniform. When he steps out, he's still got clothes on-a dark hood on in broad daylight, covering up something else underneath. Then he starts walking, and the detective follows.

First the guy he's following encounters a lake. The detective thinks, woah, huh, a false trail. But no, because the mailman just starts walking across it.

Guy thinks what the heck, rents a boat, and follows him. Now he finds on the opposite side of the lake a forest, and there's a tiny, *tiny* winding path through.

He follows the path, and eventually he reaches a mountain. This mountain is taller than the UK is wide, but the detective sees the dark-cloaked postman already half way up. So, he follows him up the mountain.

Six hours after this, and he *finally* reaches the top. He stretched his hand over, hauling up-and he sees a monastery. There are hundreds of monks waiting for him, each and every one smiling and bowed low in his direction.

So, he gets up, and walks over to the guy he recognises-it's the mailman!

He asks the mailman what's up, and why he keeps doing all this when he's a monk, and aren't monks supposed to do good, and all that, and the monk gives him the answer.

It will recalibrate your refrigerator‚Äôs coolness settings so all your ice cream melts and your milk curdles. It will give your ex-boy/girlfriend your new phone number. This virus will mix antifreeze in your fish tank. It will drink all your soda and leave dirty socks on the coffee table when you are expecting company. It will hide your car keys when you are late for work and interfere with your car radio reception so that you hear only static while stuck in traffic. When executed, ""Badtimes"" will also give you nightmares about circus midgets. It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine. It will give you Dutch Elm disease and brown patch. If the ""Badtimes"" message is opened in a Windows95 environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to a full bathtub. It will not only remove the forbidden tags from your mattresses and pillows, but it will also refill your skim milk with whole milk. It is insidious and subtle.

kbvy4w,Jokes,DarthFootball,A 2020 Working from Home Joke," A couple with young kids decided to use the term ""doing the laundry"" to in place of  ""having sex"" so the children wouldn't be asking ""what's that mean?"" questions if they overheard Mommy &amp; Daddy talking

So in a busy 2020 covid household with both the husband &amp; wife both working from home &amp; the kids learning online, instead of in school, there wasn't a lot of spare time during the day.

One day the husband's libidos kicked in and, while the wife was fixing lunch asked ""if she want to do the laundry?"" 

No she replied, ""I've gotta finish the kids lunches, do the dishes and help the kids with their homework""

Later that afternoon he asked again ""hey wanna go do the laundry now?""

No she sighed, "" Now I've got to finish those reports for work, then get dinner started and give the kids their baths after that""

An hour later the wife was thinking about his request and decided doing the laundry did sound like a great idea for both of them

She found her husband in his den and said ""if you're still in the mood, I'm ready to do the Laundry Now"" 

""That's OK"" he replied, ""It was a small load, so I just did it by Hand""",1607803850

With a mix of reluctance and excitement, Mrs. Thompkins agrees and they go off to make love in front of a--formerly--live audience. The pair find a flat tombstone to lay down upon and begin kissing, rubbing, thrusting. The sex is incredible; their faint spark ignites into a supernova.

Perhaps going a little too hard, Mrs. Thompkins gets a really bad pain in her hip, after they finish. Next day, in the early afternoon, she goes to a doctor to make sure there isn't a serious sprain.  Her physical and body inspection are done, and she patiently waits to receive the results.

Before too long, the doctor returns to her with a bewildered expression on his face.   
""Well, Mrs. Thompkins"",  he says, ""there is no fracture or sprain, just a simple over-extension of the muscle tissue; take things slow when you move and it'll straighten out in a few days.

""Oh, thank goodness"", she says, hand covering her heart in relief. ""And thank YOU, doctor!""

The doctor's forehead creases. ""Ma'am, may I ask you one, somewhat unrelated, question? A slightly strange question?""

It's Christmas Eve, he's hundreds of miles from home and the conditions are deteriorating, so he pulls into a diner parking lot, figuring some food and coffee wouldn't hurt him while he waits out the storm a bit.

Predictably, the place is empty, so Krusty has his choice of tables. He picks a booth by the window, so he can keep an eye on the worsening conditions. The waitress is festively decked out in a jingle-bell necklace, reindeer-antler headband, and ornament earrings, with a name tag that reads: Dolores. 

""What can I get for ya, hon?"" Dolores asks.

""I'll have a cup of coffee, and how are the Eggs Benedict?""

Dolores assures him they're fantastic, and says the cook makes everything in-house, so Krusty puts in his order. He's starting to feel a little less sorry for himself, even though the storm shows no sign of letting up. 

The food comes out pretty darn quick (hardly surprising since he's the only customer in the place). As Dolores comes over with the tray, he notices something strange: The food looks fantastic, but his whole meal is resting on something shiny. As she gets closer, he sees it's a hubcap.

After some inquires I'd discovered there was a gentleman in a nearby assisted care facility that had been a wildlife photographer for over 50 years.

I arranged a meeting and after exchanging pleasantries asked him ""Can you recall the time when you were the most afraid for your life, and how you reacted?""

His face lit up with excitement ""I haven't told this story in many years, but it was without a doubt the most terrified I'd ever been. I was in southern India to photograph Elephants for National Geographic. I had hired a local boy named Ishaan to help carry some of my equipment. After a few hours of tracking we found ourselves on what you would barely call a path, winding through the jungle.""

""As we rounded a rather large mahogany tree we found ourselves facing a bengal tiger. The tiger was 20 yards away and immediately began bounding towards us. I quickly turned to Ishaan as he was carrying the rifle I used for protection, only to find he was spinting very rapidly in the opposite direction."" 

""By the time I turned back to the tiger it was upon me. It let out the loudest roar I'd ever heard. Like this *ROAR*""

After the old explorer yelled out his imitation of the tiger his face sank into sadness. ""I shit my pants."" He solemnly whispered.

I tried to comfort him ""Sir don't be so hard on yourself, I'm sure anyone in the face of such a ferocious beast would..""

He cut me off ""No I mean right now, when I roared...""",1607739908

Unlike traditional tales, Snow White‚Äôs step mom, the evil queen, was actually a sexy witch who had a magical mirror.

For years, the queen would lean down exposing her ass to the mirror and ask the same question. She was satisfied every time.

One day, the mature queen asked the mirror who had the most charming asshole. She was horrified when the mirror replied.

‚ÄúYou do have the beautiful asshole, but Snow White‚Äôs asshole is most beautiful and is close to perfection.‚Äù

The queen had realized that she was no more on the top spot and most males in the kingdom fantasized on Snow White‚Äôs asshole.

She called one of her most devoted servant, the huntsman. Also known as Monstacus, for his monster cock.

‚ÄúI have a plan that will ensure my top spot in this kingdom, but I need your help to accomplish that goal,‚Äù said the queen.

‚ÄúTake Snow White into the woods and fuck her with your monster cock. She is still a virgin and unlike me, she would not be able to survive the extreme pleasure. Please bring me back her g-string as a token.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes my most beautiful queen,‚Äù said Monstacus, and he left the the castle.

An hour passes by and Monstacus comes back with what the queen requested, Snow White‚Äôs g-string.

‚ÄúPerfect, absolutely perfect, thank you my most devoted servant,‚Äù said the evil queen as she placed the g-string a collection of other g-strings.

Once again, she leaned down exposing her ass to the mirror and asked, ‚Äúmirror, mirror on the wall; who has the most charming asshole in this kingdom?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do have the beautiful asshole,‚Äù replied the mirror. The queen was satisfied.

‚ÄúHowever, Snow White‚Äôs asshole is still the most beautiful.",1607738856

- Quick, enter the closet!

He does so, and finds the kid happily staring at him. The kid goes:

- It's dark in here, ain't it?
- What?! Did you see us? Oh my god, I'll do anything so you don't tell your father!
- Anything? Uhm... I've been wishing for a baseball bat, but my parents just can't afford it for me...
- How much is it?
- 200 bucks, kind sir!
- That much? Damn, kid, you're a real mercenary.

Seeing no other option, he pays the kid and leaves as soon as the husband enters the shower.

Some days later, the kid is once again playing inside the closet, when his mom comes home with her lover. Again, they hear the father and guy enters the closet only to find the boy, as if he was waiting for him:

- It's dark in here, isn't it?
- Oh, fuck, you again? You're a bastard, aren't you? What do you want this time?
- Well, since you gave me the bat, I've been wanting to play but realized I had no ball to play with it...
- .... how much is it?
- 500 bucks!
- You fucker, let it be the last time, or else...

He pays the kid, and gets to escape freely.
Next weekend, the father wants to connect with his kid, and tells him:

- Go fetch something so we can spend the day playing together, son.

The kid comes back with his baseball bat and ball, ready to play. The father quickly realizes those were not his regular toys and asks him:

- How the hell did you get that? We surely can't afford it!
- Oh, I got it from a friend in exchange for not ratting him, dad!

The father is shocked. He didn't know he raised a kid capable of blackmail, and feeling unable to do anything himself, he decides to take the kid to church, so that he can confess and atone for his sins.

The kid has never confessed before, so he's a bit anxious, he doesn't know what to talk to the priest. Anyway, he enters the confessionary and starts:

- ... it's dark in here, ain't it?
- Fuck it, just tell your dad! I'm not giving you anything else!",1607715678

The comedian is on stage and heckling back and forth with the crowd, when suddenly he points to our gentleman and says,

""Sir, are you the back of an ass?""

The gentleman is confused. Has he missed something during a moment of reverie?

""Uh, no,"" says the gentleman.

""Well then you must be the front of an ass. Is that correct?""

The gentleman's confusion has not been resolved with this development. 

""I don't believe so,"" he says, hoping to reach the punchline and carry on with his drink, outside of the spotlight.

The comedian is ecstatic. ""Well, sir!"" He says, ""I admit, I did not expect this. Are you telling me you're NEITHER end of an ass?!""

Completely flabbergasted, the gentleman concedes defeat.

""I will admit, I do not have a comeback for you. But I do know someone who does. He is my brother, and the master of quick wit and ready repartee. One day he will come here and give you what you truly deserve.""

Days pass, and then weeks. The comedian almost completely forgets about the man's brother, the master of quick wit and ready repartee. Until one particularly slow day, a man that looks exactly like the gentleman from weeks before walks in and sits down.

This must be the master of quick wit and ready repartee.  The comedian, although surprised, was prepared. 

""You sir!"" The comedian shouts, ""Are you the back end of an ass?""

The man hardly moved a muscle, save for a shake of his head.

Feigning surprise, the comedian says ""If that's the case, you surely must be the front end of an ass!""

A moment of silence as the master of quick wit and ready repartee shook his head once more.

The comedian can hardly contain his excitement. The man is clearly saving his words for a comeback the likes of which humanity had never seen. This was the moment of truth.

""I must admit sir, I am surprised,"" he lied, ""Are you telling me that you are neither end of an ass?!""

kb6ky4,Jokes,Glynnc,The holy grail of doughnuts.,"This is a true story, and one that I often tell people. Not sure if this format works on this subreddit, but I‚Äôm going to give it a shot anyway. Hope you guys enjoy it.

One day I finally broke down and decided to give a local doughnut shop a visit. This shop was unlike any other donut shop I had ever heard of, as it specializes in gourmet doughnuts. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what that meant, but I was willing to give it a shot.

I walk in, and I am the only customer there. It is just me, and the clerk, separated by a very well lit display case filled with very, very large doughnuts, being shown off like fine jewelry. Overwhelmed by the wide selection of gourmet doughnuts, I finally say to the clerk ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been here before... what would you suggest be my first doughnut here?‚Äù He points to the last display case, which had only a single doughnut. Covered in sugar and cinnamon, drizzled with caramel, sitting on an elevated platter that was lined with what appeared to be diamonds.

‚ÄúWe call that one the Jesus doughnut.‚Äù Says the clerk. I raised a brow and looked back to him and said ‚ÄúJesus doughnut? That‚Äôs a pretty big name to give a doughnut.‚Äù
He smirks and says ‚Äúeveryone says that before they try it. Have you ever had Horchata before? It‚Äôs basically an horchata flavored doughnut.‚Äù Me being Mexican American, I‚Äôve probably drank more horchata than water. For those that don‚Äôt know, the easiest way to explain it is very sweet cinnamon flavored milk.

I really like horchata, so I nod my head and tell him I would like one of the Jesus doughnuts. He walks over to the register and asks ‚Äúdo you want that as a doughnut, or a milkshake? We basically can put all of the doughnut ingredients into a milkshake instead to make it taste like the doughnut.‚Äù I‚Äôm very, VERY, lactose intolerant, mind you, every memory of gut wrenching, toe curling bubble gut went out the window when I imagined the idea of an *horchata milkshake*. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the Jesus milkshake, please.‚Äù

When our transaction was finished, I went out to my car, and finished this huge 44oz milkshake in one sitting before I even left the parking lot. 30 minutes later, I‚Äôm at home, and I feel my stomach drop thirty feet down. The realization of the disaster that I caused finally arrived, and I rushed to the bathroom. I‚Äôm not a very religious person, but as I sat on the toilet feeling like my insides were turning to mush and blasting out of me, I knew what I was feeling. I still tell my children that that day I felt the Holy Spirit pass straight through me, and I understood them, why they call it the Jesus doughnut.",1607706001

During their stay, the Russians have a chance to wander around the city and witness everything that is going in the city, both cultural significance and less-than-desired aspects.

The night before their return, they are invited to the royal banquet. After many drinks, they open up to the Vietnamese Minister of Defense: ‚ÄúIn Russian, no-one dares piss on streets. Our police very strict, they patrol streets day and night. If they see anyone do it, they shoot. We don‚Äôt have piss on streets problem no more. Our streets stay clean &amp; fresh.‚Äù

Also intoxicated, the Minister says: ‚ÄúWonderful idea! We have try de everything from education, punishment, public shaming‚Ä¶ but nothing de work. Street pissing serious problem here.‚Äù

The Russians suggest: ‚ÄúHow about you let us try our method tonight and see if that solves your problem. We already got our guns.‚Äù

The Minister thinks this is but a joke, he laughs and says: ‚ÄúDo what you want, my good friends. I hope you scare de shit out of de street pisser.‚Äù

Thus, the Russians leave the banquet armed with their guns in the middle of the night. They circle the streets of the city, shooting everyone they see pissing on the streets, walls, trees, sideways, etc. Then they return to Russia.

In the morning, the news shakes the whole country of Vietnam. 69 Vietnamese shot dead in the nights, all caught in the act of public urination. It is called an act of terrorism and the Minister of Defense has to answer. After many arduous cabinet meetings, he hurries to the airport with his assistants to get to Russia to confront the Russian diplomats for their heinous deeds.

When they finally meet, the Russians assert: ‚ÄúYou told us it was okay to use our method. So we did. You no have smaller street pissing problem, da?‚Äù

Fuming in anger, the Minister yells: ‚ÄúI thought it was joke. How dare you do such ting and kill our people?""

Russians say: ‚ÄúWhat do you suggest we do to be even?‚Äù

The Vietnamese suggest: ‚ÄúWe will do to your citizens what you did to ours. We take our guns, patrol your city tonight, and shoot everyone we see pissing publicly. EVERYONE!‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal!‚Äù, agree the Russians. ‚ÄúWe have used the method long time. Our people are scared straight, no-one dares piss on streets.‚Äù

Frustrated, they almost give up until they see two people pissing on a wall in a dark path. Thinking it is now their chance to exact vengeance, they empty the guns at the two people.

They reach a red light where the pick up driver pulls ahead of the car. He steps out of the trucks and drags the man out of the car. He notices the man to be very scared.

The truck driver removes a piece of chalk a knife from his truck, draws a circle on the road and tells the frightened car driver to stand in the circle. 

He screams at the man ""You will be sorry for your life if you come out of the circle"" and then proceeds to cut up the nice leather seats in the car. Thinking he had done enough he turns around to find the man smiling. 

Even more angry he returns to his truck and gets a baseball bat out and smashes all the windows and lights. When he looks again the man is giggling. 

Starting to rage now, the trucker drops the bat and slashes all his tyres to which the man bursts out laughing. 


Well, the trucker finally loses it, gets a can of gasoline from the truck, pours it all over the brand new sports car and sets it on fire.

So Dopey walks over to the priest and says ""Father can I ask you a question?""

""Sure my son, ask away"" says the preacher.

""Are there,"" Dopey paused a second, ""are there nuns in Alaska?""

The priest looks at him oddly and says ""Well of course there are.""

As dopey starts to walk away, the other 6 dwarves start urging him ""Go ask the real question Dopey! We need to know!""

Dopey slowly walks back over and says ""I have another question father, are there black nuns in Alaska?""

The priest seems puzzled but answers anyways ""Yes son, I know a few black nuns in Alaska. I'm not sure why you needed to ask this.""

""Thanks father, I appreciate you answering me."" Dopey says as he walks away. He gets back to the group and they're not happy with him.

""Go ask the real question Dopey! We all want to know because there's no way it's true.""

So Dopey walks back over and say ""Father I have one last question. Are there any midget black nuns in Alaska?""

At this point the priest is visibly upset with Dopey. ""Would you stop wasting my time? Of course not. There are no midget black nuns in Alaska. Get out of the church please.""

The man later goes down stairs at his stop but the bus driver tells him that he saw him in his mirror and read his lips so knows what he said to the nun.

The next week the man is there in the dark woodland and as the nun appears he jumps out before her but he is dressed in a long brown robe, sandals, false long beard, crown of thorns and says, ‚Äòsister, behold it is I, Jesus and I come to make love to you as you husband‚Äô. She throws herself at his feet and wails that she is so sorry but it is her time of the month and he sighs, wishes her well and says he should leave. ‚ÄòNo, no my lord, I cannot miss this holy congress with you so you could put it in another place, if you wish‚Äô, she pleads. He agrees, she bends over a large tree stump and the act takes place after which the man breaks down crying and screaming for forgiveness telling the nun that he is really the man on the bus from last week.
