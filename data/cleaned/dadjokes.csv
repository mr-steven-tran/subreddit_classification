I hope this isn't a re-run for too many of you.This was  years ago when my son was starting middle school. I was transporting him  and a group of his new friends. One of the friends was French, and  spoke French at home. My son mentioned that I had taken French in high  school, and so one of his friends asked me to say something in French  and see if French girl could understand me.Before  I go on, a note on parenting style: we joke around with our kids all  the time. I know that not all parents joke with their children; some of  my kids' friends enjoyed to a dad who makes a joke, and some would look  at me like I grew a second head.So I said to the French girl, «quelque chose». Immediately the friends turned to French girl and asked ""What did he say?""I waited, wondering whether she would join my joke.A  sly smile crept across her face as she said, ""he said...something"". The  rest of the trip, the friends tried to convince her to reveal what it  was that I had said. «quelque chose» is the French phrase for  ""something"".",2020-12-27 16:37:12,6,225,36,1148

kcbtyf,1,plasticrockingchair,So an english woman and a black woman got into a fight at a Victoria's Secret.,"Officer Riley was used to being tasked to cases like these. In fact, he got assigned to these cases so much that he had gotten pretty good at resolving these situations in a way where everyone left happy, but Riley found these cases really boring. Still, he finished his doughnut, took a sip of his coffee, and began to make his way to the store.He got to the store pretty quickly. The cop cars outside let him know he was in the right place. As he pulled up, he made eye contact with Officer Patrick, and he promptly got out of his car to meet him. After a quick greeting Patrick began to explain the situation. ""An english woman and a black woman got into a fight but the women involved are either too distraught or angry to talk to us,"" Officer Patrick explained. He didn't need to say anything more. Riley looked towards the entrance of the Victoria's Secret and immediately saw the two ladies in question. One of them was sitting on the sidewalk holding her head, and a few feet away from her was the other woman still very clearly upset.Riley decided that the woman on the sidewalk needed his help first as he was confident she lost the fight. He approached her and introduced himself and told her that he needed to know what happened. After some poking and proding she finally began to talk. ""I was just talking on the phone and that lady over just came up to me and started screaming at the top of her lungs,"" the english woman said. ""Surely there was more to it than that,""  Riley said, ""Can you recall saying anything on the phone that may have set her off?"" She swore up and down that she was just having a regular conversation with a friend, and she didn't say anything that could've offended anyone.Now that he got one side of the story it was time to talk to the other woman. Riley made his way past the officers trying to calm her down, and introduced himself as he did with the english woman. Luckily the other officers seemed to have calmed down a bit since he got there. She admitted to beating up the other woman with just a single ask, but now he needed to know why. ""Why'd you do it?"" Riley asked.""That bitch is racist!"" the black woman said. ""She was walking into the Victoria's Secret and I heard her say that she needed to buy some knickers!""",2020-12-13 07:52:03,16,424,78,2266

I asked him what kind of a bird it was and he told me it’s a rare almost extinct species called a Foux (pronounced Foo). This foux was the apple of his eye and he would take care of the bird as if it was his own child.Sometime during this period the Foux began developing a real bad case of constipation and my father was really worried about it. He tried all kinds if medicines to make the Foux pass it’s bowels, but nothing was working.One day, during this period, I woke up to a huge argument taking place between my parents. My mom was accusing him of cheating on her during one of his tours, she had found some pictures of him and another woman and he was denying it vehemently. I realized then that my father had been quite the philanderer and this wasn’t the first time he had been caught. My mom was trying to get him to just admit to his indiscretion.""Why don’t you just admit it Harry"", she said; but he stuck to his denial, ""You think I could ever do something like this Sarah"", he said. Right then amidst all this ruckus, the Foux began to take a dump, in the middle of the living room.My mom looked at the bird, then looked back at my dad and with a sense of resignation she just said ""Well if the Foux shits...""",2020-12-03 07:05:29,6,263,28,1357

jyk00c,1,Pensrule2007,Prom night,"It was time for the prom at Klondike High School and Tim's friends were desperately trying to convince him to go. He considered it, but was very self-conscious of the fact that he had had an accident as a young child that caused him to lose his eye, and the best his family could afford was to buy him a wooden eye. After several days of goading, Tim finally decides to go. Sally was in a similar situation. Her friends desperately wanted her to go prom with them, but she was recently in a car accident and lost her right leg. She had a prosthetic, but it was very uncomfortable, so she had a hard time walking. Reluctantly, she agreed to go. It was the night of the prom and both Tim and Sally were getting all gussied up with their friends. They both make it to the prom, but when they arrive, they are both too nervous to dance. Tim's friends notice Sally sitting on the wall and say to him, ""Look over there! There's a cute girl who's all alone and needs a partner to dance with. Why don't you go over there and ask her to dance?"" After some further convincing, Tim sheepishly begins to walk over to Sally to ask her. As he approaches her, he getes nervous, and awkwardly stands in front of her for a few seconds before saying, ""Wuh...wuh...would you like to dance with me?""Excitedly, Sally exclaims, ""Would I? Would I?""Tim responds angrily, ""PEG LEG! PEG LEG!""",2020-11-21 15:30:12,2,254,10,1366

It was a hell of a Journey, but it was time for me to hang up my guitar. I retired from the rock star life and got an office job in Tokyo.I made a few friends at work, and grew close with one in particular, Narada-san.One day Narada had the day off for a funeral, but that wasn't enough; he needed more time. He was torn between his obligation to return to work and his desire to have more time at home. He asked me what he should do.The answer was simple.

He only stole bells. Any kind of bell, whether a tiny bell from a kitten’s collar, all the way up to the bell from the king’s royal bell tower. When the king awoke one morning, the bell tower’s bell was missing. The king, being brave and noble, decided to follow the thief back to his lair. He chose four of his most loyal soldiers, mounted his horse, and rode off into the snowy woods, following the footprints left behind on the ground. Soon, he and his soldiers arrived to a clearing in the woods. In front of them was a large, bell-shaped building. They found the thief’s lair!Pointing to the recent tracks left in the snow by the thief, the king announced to the soldiers, ""Look!

jt4c3n,1,Frnklfrwsr,"The greatest baseball player ever was a guy named Hugh McBealy, and he was most famous for every single time he came to the plate knocking the ball high over right field and into the stands.","He scored a home run every single at bat, and always the exact same way. Way over right field, too high for anyone to reach, and it always landed in exactly the 17th row of the stands, give or take a couple feet. He earned the nickname ""the machine"" for how consistently he hit the exact same spot every time. Right field, 17th row, every single time. He did this for 20 years before he retired. Tickets to the 2-3 seats that the ball always landed on sold for over $2k a pop by the time he retired because you were guaranteed at least a couple home run balls. And the day he retired a reporter asked him ""How does it feel to be retiring as the greatest hitter of all time?""Hugh just looked at the reporter puzzled. ""What do you mean?"" He said. The reporter clarified ""literally over 5,000 times you went to the plate and hit a home run to right field, 17th row of the stands!""Hugh looked dejected and disappointed ""yeah, my greatest failure...""""What do you mean?"" Said the reporter incredulously.

Long joke!,"A man named Dave comes home very drunk late at night...So this guy has been drinking with his buddies all night and he's as drunk as a skunk, gets home, falls up the stairs, undresses and goes to bed next to his wife. He falls asleep and next thing he knows, *bang*, he dies and finds himself waiting at the pearly gates.The guy refuses to believe this is happening, he says to St. Peter: ""This can't be possible, I'm a healthy man! This is not the way I die. You have to let me return down there!""  The guy can see St. Peter looks like he's feeling sorry for him, but he tells him that unfortunately, there's no policy for allowing people back on Earth. The guy insists: ""But come on, there's got to be something you can do! I'll put up with anything, really, as long as you let me go back down.""  So St. Peters tells him: ""Well really, there's just this one possibility: you can go back, but only as a hen. That's the only thing we can allow."" The guy guesses that this really is his only chance, so he agrees reluctantly.  So he's back on Earth in this beautiful chicken coop, the sun is shining, there's green grass everywhere, this is hen paradise. The other hens greet him with delight and he tells them his story, everything goes nicely. But then he feels kind of unwell, there's something wrong with his stomach. He asks this old hen: ""Tell me, I've got this weird feeling in my belly, I'm not too well. What is happening to me?""The old hen: ""Well dearie, we hens lay eggs, you know. I bet you've never laid a nice egg before... You need to push it out now, and you'll feel much better after!""  So the guy pushes and pushes, and *wham*, out pops his first egg. The old hen congratulates him and he feels much better. But not 5 minutes later, his pain comes back. He returns to the old hen for advice.""Well dearie, it's quite special but it happens that you need to lay TWO eggs, so go back there and keep pushing!""   So he goes back to his nest and pushes, and nothing comes, and he pushes harder, and *wham*, out comes his second egg! He feels much better, but not 2 minutes later, you guessed it, he's back in terrible pain and goes to see the old hen.""What's this bullshit here, and don't tell me I've got a third egg to lay!"" The old hen can't make head or tail of it and just tells him that when in doubt, he should be pushing. So the guy goes back to work and then, *wham*, his wife wakes him up with this smashing slap in the face and yells: ""*Dave!

kn9abh,0,BinBender,The tale of two worms,"Maggie and Magnus were worming out and about when they came to a river, and saw they had just missed the boat. To make matters worms, they couldn’t dig their way under the river. Maggie wanted to turn around, but Magnus said there was a bridge nearby, and insisted a bridge isn’t a dime a dozen, and it was completely free, so in the end, it was only a blessing in disguise that they missed the boat. So they crawled along the river until they came to the bridge. Magnus was the best of both worms when it came to wriggling fast, so he went first.  ""Fingers crossed! Break a leg!"" shouted Maggie encouragingly after him.  Magnus turned and shouted back, ""Get your act together, I don’t have any of those!""  (I won’t beat around the bush, Maggie’s an idiot when it comes to idioms, but I’d let her off the hook. My poor uncle was never let off the hook, and to make a long worm short, he drowned.)  Anyway, as Magnus wriggled his way over the bridge, he was run over by a car.  ""Hang in there!"" Maggie shouted, and hurried to see if he had bit the dust, or just been bent out of shape. As it turned out, the car had only run over the tip of Magnus’ tail, and made him shit his pant.  ""Things almost got out of hand there,"" he admitted to Maggie, ""but no pain no gain, and I’m glad I got that out of my system, I’ve been constipated for a week!""  ""Well, pull yourself together, easy does it, but this is neither the time nor place to hit the sack.""  Shortly after, Magnus was run over again, and Maggie didn’t need to pull his leg to know he had perished.""That’s the last straw!"" Maggie exclaimed. ""I knew we shouldn’t have crossed this bridge when we came to it!""(After Magnus died, I was worried this joke had no punchline, but then I realized you only need one worm to form a line.)",2020-12-30 12:48:20,5,349,21,1783

kmp2s4,0,ChaoticGoodWhatsIts,The Afterlife,"A businessman dies and finds himself in The Afterlife. To his surprise, it’s not at all like he’d heard. Every single religion was wrong.The walls smell like mildew, it’s dark, and the air is moist and pungent.Suddenly, he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and sees a homeless man he’d passed almost every day on his walk between the train station and his office building.""Holy crap! What are you doing here?""""I died, too,"" explains the homeless man. ""I woke up a few days ago and found myself here.""""Well, at least there’s a familiar face. What is this place?""""This crap hole is the lowest level of The Afterlife,"" says the homeless man. ""You must’ve done something pretty terrible to end up down here.""""Well, I was waiting to cross the road and this insufferable hipster was standing next to me —""Just then, a gong sounded three times: BONG! BONG! BONG!The businessman watched as everyone around them slowly assembled into three separate lines, grimacing and eye-rolling all the way.""What’s this all about?""""You arrived just in time for dinner."" The homeless man gestured to the three lines. ""That line over there is for a half-eaten, moldy hot dog bun. The middle line is for bland creamed corn that they drop on the floor right before serving it. The last line is putrid sewer water with floating bits of god-knows-what.""""Ugh,"" groans the businessman. They shuffle through each line, find a couple ass-numbing, uneven rock stools and choke down their food.As they’re eating, the homeless man educates the businessman about The Afterlife.""It turns out there’s four levels. We, of course, are in the lowest level.""""Is it possible to get to the next level?""""Yeah,"" replies the homeless man, lowering his voice. He gestures behind him. ""See that guard next to that door? He can be bribed.""""Woah! How much?""""He wants $1,000.""""Well, I ain’t got shit else to do,"" says the businessman.He secures a job and, after about a year, raises $1,000.He walks up to the guard, opens his coat, and shows the stack of bills to the guard. The guard looks around, pockets the money, and opens a door to the third level of The Afterlife. The businessman slips through, and the door slams shut.He looks around. He finds himself in a studio apartment. The walls are cracked and stained, the shag carpet hasn’t been vacuumed in years, several lights are burned out, but it ain’t a dungeon.He descends a few flights of stairs and heads out to a small, overgrown courtyard bordered by neglected shrubs. The sky is overcast. People are milling about; a handful are trying to play basketball with an under-inflated ball and looking rather disappointed, but making the best of it.He feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and sees the homeless man grinning up at him!""Oh man, you’re here, too!""""Yep,"" replies the homeless man. ""Got here about a week ago.""""That’s great! I’m glad to see a familiar face,"" the businessman says as a stray dog pees on a broken street lamp a few feet away.""So, we never finished our conversation last year,"" recalled the homeless man. ""What did you do that you ended up in the lowest level of The Afterlife?""""Well, I was waiting to cross the road and this insufferable hipster was standing next to me, talking loudly into his phone, and a bus was driving down the street towards us—""Again, a loud gong sounded: **BONG! BONG! BONG!**And again, people slowly organized themselves into three lines.""Lunchtime?"" inquired the businessman.""Yeah."" The homeless man gestured to the three lines. ""In that line, you get a hamburger with the consistency of a hockey puck and a stale bun. In the second line, a handful of broken potato chips. And in the third line, flat Coke.""""Well, it’s better than the crap in the last level.""The men both make their way through the lines and find a wet picnic table. As they sit and their pants slowly take in the dampness, the businessman inevitably asks:""So, there’s gotta be a way to get to Level 2, right?""""Yeah,"" the homeless man talks in a hushed tone. ""See that guard behind me?""He gestures. The businessman sees a guard standing next to the door of a rusted-out porta-potty.""Yeah. How much?""""Two hundred thousand.""The businessman nearly spits out his charred burger. He wipes his mouth and shrugs.""Well, I ain’t got shit else to do.""He takes a job and, after ten years, raises $200,000.He wanders over to the guard at the shit house. He unzips a duffel bag and opens it. The guard looks down into the duffel, zips it back up, slings it over his shoulder, and turns his back on the businessman.The businessman opens the door of the porta-potty and walks in.To his amazement, a lavish home opens up before his eyes. There’s a polished grand piano sitting in the corner of a room filled with books. Another room has a brand new billiards table with shiny balls, lined up and ready for a game. Hunting trophies adorn the walls.He wanders through the home, opens a pair of French doors, and finds himself on a veranda overlooking a courtyard. Several people are laughing and enjoying a game of beach volleyball.He feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and, once again, finds the homeless man smiling up at him.""Oh man, I’m so glad to see you!""""Yep,"" replied the homeless man. ""Here we are again! I got here a few months ago.""They catch up, having a great time and laughing.There’s a lull in the conversation. The homeless man, once again, breaks the silence:""We never finished our conversation 11 years ago. What did you do that you ended up on the lowest level of The Afterlife?""""Well, I was waiting to cross the road and this insufferable hipster was standing next to me, talking loudly into his phone, and a bus was driving down the street towards us, so I put my hand in the hipster’s shoulder and —""**BONG! BONG! BONG!**Once again, people began organizing themselves into three lines.""The food here has *gotta* be great!"" The businessman looked eager for some food.""Oh, you know it!"" The homeless man gestured to the first line: ""That line is for barbecue pulled pork. Any kind of barbecue sauce you want, they have. The second line is for cole slaw, potato salad, and a slice of any kind of pie you can think of. The third line has every microbrew in existence!""They load up their plates, find two large leather chairs and sit down. They’re having a great time when the businessman’s curiosity gets the better of him.""There’s *gotta* be a way to the top level of The Afterlife, right?""""Yeah,"" replies the homeless man in a hushed tone. He gestures over his shoulder. ""See that guy at the door to the cabana? Ten million dollars and you’re in.""""Holy shit!"" He nearly chokes on a piece of Kentucky-bourbon barbecue pork. ""Well, I ain’t got shit else to do.""The businessman takes a job and, after 100 years, secures ten million dollars.He walks up to the guard at the cabana. He cracks open a metal suitcase, revealing stacks upon stacks of bills. The guard looks around, closes the suitcase, picks it up, and wanders away from the cabana.The businessman walks through the cabana door.The doors squeak shut as the businessman is blinded by brilliant gold light.As his eyes adjust, his breath is taken away. A chorus of cherubs heralds his arrival with an epic symphony, moving him to tears.Marble pillars tower above him. Light shines down from three bright suns, casting rays through glorious, intricate stained glass windows. Elaborate fountains punctuate the crystal-clear waterways bordering every single mirrored walking path. Gorgeous, scantily-dressed women offer him intricate hors d’oeuvres and glasses of champagne at every bend in the pathway.He feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and, sure enough, the homeless man is beaming at him.""I can’t believe it!"" exclaims the businessman, who tightly hugs the homeless man. ""We’re in the top level of The Afterlife!""""It’s fantastic, isn’t it? I got here a few months before you. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined this!""They walk on and catch up, laughing and enjoying themselves.Eventually, the homeless man asks again: ""We never finished the conversation we started 111 years ago. How did you end up in the lowest level of The Afterlife?""""Well, I was waiting to cross the road and this insufferable hipster was standing next to me, talking loudly into his phone, and a bus was driving down the street towards us, so I put my hand in the hipster’s shoulder, waited for the bus to get closer, and —""**BONG! BONG! BONG!**Once again, the inhabitants lined themselves up into three lines.""Holy shit, get a load of this,"" starts the homeless man. ""The first line is bacon-wrapped filet mignon medallions cooked any way you want. The second line is garlic-butter mashed red potatoes. And the *third* line..."" The homeless man trails off, the smile fades from his face, and suddenly seems lost in thought.""What? *What?* What’s in the third line?!"" The businessman begs for an explanation.The homeless man looks down at the ground. Under his breath, he says, ""I gotta know. I *just* gotta know."" He slowly turns to the business man, puts his hand on his arm, and asks, ""After 111 years and one million, two hundred and one thousand dollars: would you have come all this way if you’d known there was no punchline?""",2020-12-29 15:56:00,2,1572,13,9242

Steve, you and I will walk up the beam one at a time and perch on top of the wall. Donald you then throw up the flashlight and Steve will aim the beam back down toward you so you can walk up.  Then we just do the opposite on the other side and slide down the beam to freedom.’Upon hearing this plan Steven can barely contain his excitement. He reminds Rudy to make sure there are fresh batteries, and he should triple check the contacts to make sure nothing fails. Donald on the other hand shakes his head furiously, leans in toward Rudy and whispers aggressively ‘Look at this wiseguy.  Whaddya think I am stoopid or sumthing?

But I have a question, why is your head so small?"" The big guy nods slowly. He's obviously fielded this question many times. ""One day,"" he begins, ""I was hunting and got lost in the woods. I heard someone crying for help. I followed the cries and they led me to a frog that was sitting next to a stream."" ""No shit?"" says the bartender, thoroughly intrigued. ""Yeah, so I picked up the frog and it said, Kiss me. Kiss me and I will turn into a genie and grant you three wishes.'"" ""Keep going!"" ""I looked around to make sure I was alone and gave the frog a kiss. POOF! The frog turned into a beautiful, voluptuous, naked woman. She said, You now have three wishes.' I looked down at my scrawny 115 pound body and said, I want a body like Arnold Schwarzenneger.' She nodded, snapped her fingers, and POOF there I was, so huge that I ripped out of my clothes and was standing there naked! She then asked, What will be your second wish?'"" ""What next?"" begged the bartender. ""I looked hungrily at her beautiful body and replied, I want to make sensuous love with you here by this stream.' She nodded, laid down, and beckoned to me. We made love right there by that stream for hours! Afterwards, as we lay there next to each other, sweating from our glorious lovemaking, she whispered into my ear, You know, you do have one more wish. What will it be?'

When I got home, sure as shit there she was naked in bed!! looked all over the apartment but I couldn't find the guy anywhere so I went out onto the balcony, we live on the 25th floor, and there he was! Hanging over the edge by his fingertips! I ran inside, grabbed a hammer, and started smacking his hands and fingers with it! He finally let go and fell down 25 stories but he landed in some bushes, so I ran inside and grabbed the refrigerator and heaved it over the balcony down on top of him, crushing him and killing him! But the strain and exertion from picking up the refrigerator gave me a heart attack and I died.""  Saint Peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let this poor soul in.  Another man came walking up to the gates and Saint Peter told this man the same thing, that in order to get in he had to make St. Peter laugh. The second guy told him about how he died.  ""Well St. Peter, it was awful, I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th story apartment when a flock of birds came out of nowhere and startled me! I fell over the railing but managed to grab the balcony of the apartment below me. All of a sudden, some maniac came outside and started hitting my hands with a hammer until I let go! Luckily, I landed in some bushes but then this guy dropped a freaking refrigerator on me!""  Saint Peter chuckled again, let the second man into heaven, and decided he could really start to enjoy his job. A third man came walking up to the pearly gates.  Saint Peter gave his speech to this third man and then told him:  ""Tell me about the day you died  ""Oh man, you're never gonna believe this!

kmbjn7,0,Shagzter,Trucker is hauling a B-double with three containers full of computer parts.,"It's getting on toward dark, and so he stops at a steakhouse for a bite.The first thing he sees is a sign on the door: NO THONGS NO SINGLETS NO NERDSMANAGEMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ADMISSION No nerds? Weird. But whatever. Upon entering, he sees a big poster on a noticeboard:NERD SEASON OPENS 5 JULY That's today, he thinks. What's this about? He approaches the bar to get a drink and order a meal, but as he steps up, the big guy behind the bar gives him a suspicious look. ""Are you a nerd?"" the bartender demands, with slitted eyes and a sneer on his lips. ""What? No, I'm a trucker!"" ""You *smell* like a nerd!"" insists the bartender, and his hand makes its way below the bar.""Huh? Oh, wait! I've got a big load of computer bits on board. Maybe that's what you can smell on me!""The bartender relaxes and smiles, and his hand returns to view. ""Ah, - that would be it. Sorry mate. What'll it be?""The trucker gets his meal and brew, and takes a seat in the corner. As he's finishing up, the door opens, and a guy walks in. He's got thin slicked down hair, parted on the left, dandruff on his shoulders, thick glasses and a face full of pimples. He's wearing a short sleeved business shirt, with a pocket protector full of pens, pleated pants that stop well above his ankles, showing white socks below an expanse of pale skin, under black leather shoes. There is a calculator attached to his belt.The bartender glances up, and doesn't hesitate for even a moment. Hand goes under the bar and comes out with a shotgun, and in one smooth movement he aims and fires both barrels together from the waist. The nerd goes down in a spray of body parts, Biro ink and calculator buttons. The trucker is speechless. Wow, he thinks, - they really take their nerd season seriously around these parts. He pays and leaves quickly, somewhat unsettled. The night wears on behind the wheel, and the trucker fights the all-too-common battle to maintain concentration on the road. An idiot in a beat-up Commodore blasts past him without enough clear road ahead and merges back early, and instead of holding his line and letting the muppet wear his bullbar, he instinctively pulls to the left and loses control in the gravel on the verge.The truck goes over and slides into the wall near the end of a cutting, and the containers bust open and spill their contents. The driver pulls himself free, mostly unhurt, and tries to take stock of his position.Then he hears a rustling on all sides, and as his eyes get used to the gloom, he realises that there are nerds everywhere! They're crawling out from the bushes and from behind rocks, bristling with pocket protectors and calculator holsters, rummaging through the strewn computer parts, comparing them with those that other nerds have grabbed, and bickering over the comparative specs of the various parts.Anxious to protect what he could of his load, the trucker suddenly remembered what he saw at the steakhouse: nerd season was open! He reached into his cab and found his own rifle behind the seat. Left, right, middle. Blam! Blam! Blam! He started dropping them where they stood.At that point, he saw approaching red and blues, and a short time later the police were all over everything. ""Hey! Police! Drop your weapon!"" The trucker was astonished. ""Hey, I'm just protecting what's mine! This firearm is registered, I'm licensed, and nerd season opened today!"" ""Yes,"" replied the OIC, "" - but you're not allowed to bait them!""",2020-12-29 02:58:30,12,611,75,3464

km8twg,0,Artemis1998,This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years.,".....the only friction in their marriage was the husbands habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said ""Honey you were right all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you"". ""What do you mean?"" asked his wife. ""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers.

Must be able to type, must be good with a computer and must be bilingual. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer.""","A short time afterwards, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign and went inside. He looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then walked over to the sign, looked at it and whined. Getting the idea, the receptionist got the office manager. The office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least. However, the dog looked determined, so he led him into the office. Inside, the dog jumped up on the chair and stared at the manager. The manager said, ""I can't hire you. The sign says you have to be able to type."" The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type out a perfect letter. He took out the page and trotted over to the manager and gave it to him, then jumped back on the chair. The manager was stunned, but then told the dog, ""The sign says you have to be good with a computer."" The dog jumped down again and went to the computer. The dog proceeded to demonstrate his expertise with various programs and produced a sample spreadsheet and database and presented them to the manager. By this time the manager was totally dumbfounded! He looked at the dog and said, ""I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and have some interesting abilities. However, I still can't give you the job."" The dog jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put his paw on the part about being an Equal Opportunity Employer. The manager said, ""Yes, but the sign also says that you have to be bilingual."" The dog looked at him straight in the face and said, ""Meow.""",2020-12-28 14:38:10,39,282,210,1504

klx7fy,0,rnicholson77,Parrot with no legs,"A man decides on a day that it is time to buy a pet. He goes to the pet  store, looks around and sees a beautiful parrot, sitting quietly on a  stick in his cage. Yet the beast has no feet and paws. ""What is the  matter with you?"" the man thinks aloud. ""Well, that’s how I was born, I’m actually a faulty parrot"" says the  bird. ""Haha,"" the man laughs, ""it seems like that parrot understands what I’m  saying and even answers!"" ""I understand everything you say, I am extremely intelligent and very  well educated,"" says the bird. ""Well, if you’re so smart then tell me how you can stay on your stick  without legs."" ""Well,"" says the parrot, ""it’s a bit embarrassing, but okay, I wrap my  little parrot penis around the stick, like a hook, but I hide that with  my thick feathers."" ""Wow, you really understand everything I say, do not you?"" ""Yes, yes,"" replies the bird, ""and I speak Spanish and English fluently,  I can speak on a level about almost everything, politics, religion,  sport and philosophy and I specialize in bird science, you should buy  me, I am also a very good friend for you. "" The man looks at the price tag, 200 euros is on it. ""Sorry, I can not  afford that."" ""Psst,"" whispers the parrot as he beckons the man with his wing closer.  ""Nobody wants me because I do not have legs, just bid 25 euros and you  can take me with you."" The man offers 25 euros and walks 5 minutes later with the parrot out of  the store. A few weeks pass. The parrot is sensational. He is fun and  interesting, gives good advice, is sympathetic to everyone, in short;  the perfect roommate and friend. One day the man comes home from work  and the parrot says ""Pssssssssssst"" while he beckons his wing again. The  man comes close to the cage. ""I do not know if I should tell you this,""  says the parrot, ""but it’s about your wife and the postman."" ""What!?"" says the man. ""Well, the postman came to the door and your wife greeted him in a  nothing disguised nightgown and kissed him flat on the mouth."" ""And then,"" the man hisses, ""What happened then?"" ""Well, the postman came in, grabbed her nightgown and started caressing  her everywhere."" ""My God,"" says the now furious man, ""And what else did they do?"" ""Then he took off her nightgown, went through his knees and started to  lick her everywhere, starting at her breasts and getting further and  further down."" ""And then, what happened, what else did they do?"" the man screams . ""No idea,"" says the papgaai, ""I got a boner and fell off my stick  …""",2020-12-28 12:32:51,4,486,19,2499

Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Colin how about Tom Cruise?""   ""Sure, yes, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""    So Colin and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door and sure enough, Tom Cruise shouts, ""Colin! Great to see  you! You and your friend come right in and join me for lunch!""    Although impressed, Colin's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Colin that he thinks Colin's knowing Cruise was just lucky.    ""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Colin says.    ""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts. ""Yes,"" Colin  says, ""I know him, let's fly out to Washington."" And off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Colin on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Colin, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a cup of coffee first and catch up.""   Well, his boss is now very shaken but still not totally convinced of Colin's claim.    After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Colin, who again implores him to name anyone else. His boss pauses for a minute to think of one final person who Colin would never be able to say he knows.""The Pope,""  his boss replies. ""Sure!"" says Colin. ""My folks are from Poland, and I've known the Pope a long time."" So off they fly to Rome. Colin and his boss are assembled with the masses in Vatican Square when Colin says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let  me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" And he disappears into the crowd headed toward the Vatican.Sure enough, 20 minutes later Colin emerges with the Pope on the balcony but by the time Colin returns, he finds that his boss has fainted and is surrounded by paramedics. Working his way to his boss' side, Colin asks him, ""What happened?!"" His boss looks up and says, ""I was doing fine until you and the Pope came out on the balcony and the man next to me yelled, ""Who the fuck is that up there with Colin?""",2020-12-28 12:29:47,12,433,61,2201

Instantly, ""deem"" became the only positive descriptor in these kids' collective vocabularies.  ""Check out this deem lanyard I made.""  ""Archery class is totally deem.""  It drove me nuts.What's worse, some of my fellow counselors started using it too.  Mostly it was the ones desperate to earn the approval of the campers, but slowly it spread until even the coolest girl on staff would say ""deem"" from time to time.Speaking of her, she really was remarkable.  All the boys in camp would giggle when she passed by, and I must admit she even challenged my composure when she was around.  Very pretty, air of untouchability, the works.  But most of all, her eyes were stunning, a steel grey color that absolutely stood out.  People said that in low light, they would practically glow.I bring this up only to insert a momentary brag.  At one point late in the summer, I worked up the nerve to ask her out and she said yes.  We rode into town for dinner, and then, when we returned, I rekindled the campfire, hoping for some high-school-grade canoodling.I turned to look at her, and, by the way, her eyes did not glow in the low light.  I honestly think she could sense my disappointment, because she said, ""Rumors of my deem eyes have been greatly exaggerated.""",2020-12-27 21:12:44,2,298,11,1615

He has a million dollars in his account.""The Director comes out, approaches the shoeshine, and says:""Mr. Smith, I ask you this coming Monday to be the guest of honor at our board meeting and tell us the story of your life. I am sure we will have something to learn from you.""At the board meeting, the Executive Director introduces him to the board members:""We all know Mr. Smith, who makes our shoes shine in the corner; But Mr. Smith is also our esteemed customer with a million dollars in his account. I invited him to tell us the story of his life. I am sure we can learn from him.""Mr. Smith began his story:""I came to this country fifty years ago as a young immigrant from Europe with an unpronounceable name. I got off the ship without a penny. The first thing I did was change my name to Smith. I was hungry and exhausted. I started wandering around looking for a job but to no avail. Suddenly I found a coin on the sidewalk. I bought an apple. I had two options: eat the apple and quench my hunger or start a business. I sold the apple for two dollars and bought two apples with the money. I also sold them and continued in business. When I started accumulating dollars, I was able to buy a set of used brushes and shoe polish and started polishing shoes. I didn't spend a penny on entertainment or clothing, I just bought bread and some cheese to survive. I saved penny by penny and after a while, I bought a new set of shoe brushes and ointments in different shades and expanded my clientele. I lived like a monk and saved penny by penny. After a while I was able to buy an armchair so that my clients could sit comfortably while cleaning their shoes, and that brought me more clients. I did not spend a penny on the joys of life. I kept saving every penny. A few years ago, when the previous shoe shine on the corner decided to retire, I had already saved enough money to buy his shoeshine location at this great place.Finally, three months ago, my sister, who was a whore in Chicago, passed away and left me a million dollars.""",2020-12-27 08:03:32,4,515,21,2852

kl0177,0,Elo_Solo,A construction crew started building a new house down the street.,"My daughter was excited to see the big construction vehicles, so I let her go check it out (with me watching of course). The crew loved that a young person was interested in construction, so let her sit and watch them work.  Sometimes they would sit her in the trucks and show her how it operates, even gave her a few odd jobs here and there, made her feel like part of the team.The crew boss even noticed, and after a week, they gave her a pay envelope of ten dollars.  I thought this was so great, and the crew was so nice, so I took my daughter down to the bank to open a savings account, teaching her about the work force, how pay works, what a bank does, and the importance of money.I told the teller at the bank the whole story about the construction crew, her interest in working, and that I’m teaching her the value of the dollar. The teller smiles at my daughter and goes,""This is such an important lesson for life, and I’m so glad that you’re learning this now.

The quick, rough current and sharp, short turns pose a difficult challenge for even the most experienced of kayakers. Once you flip, the unforgiving water makes righting yourself and continuing safely very difficult. Bang! The race begins. All three are neck to neck, just keeping up with each other. Then, suddenly, the Christian starts to paddle even harder, thus breaking pace, to pull ahead. Finding a good tempo, the Christian begins to pull ahead of the other two. With the added power of the river, he soon goes out of sight.Determined not to let him escape, the Muslim also moves up a gear, leaving the Jew behind. Soon enough, he is also out of sight. The Jew is tempted to rush in, but he considers it and resolves that a steady course is the best option, just like many fables have suggested.Sure enough, the Jew soon finds the now wet Christian and Muslim panting and tired, sluggishly navigating the water. As the Jew passes, the other two begin to rush again. Attempting to cover the distance, they grow unsteady and then flip into the water once more. This continues over and over again with the Jew pulling ahead farther and farther. With the end in sight, the Jew wins with a good margin. Panting, the Christian and Muslim ask the Jew, ""We put in so much energy into moving faster. How did you beat us?""""Well,"" replied the Jew, ""I like to take it slow and keep it steady. Oh!

kkwppi,0,USPSA-Addict,A man is driving down the road one day when his car breaks down in front of a monastery.,"He goes up to the monastery and before he can even ask for help, the monks invite him in, they feed him a delicious dinner, they let him sleep the night, and in the morning, before breakfast, they inform him that they fixed his car overnight.But during the night, the man had heard a strange noise coming from deep within the monastery. The noise was beautiful and yet haunting— once he had heard it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to get it out of his head. And the man could not begin to identify in his mind what was making the noise. So in the morning, over breakfast, the man asks the monks:""Hey, what was making that sound from within the monastery?""""We’re very sorry,"" they reply, ""we cannot tell you, because you’re not a monk.""After a moment of pause the man accepts this. ""Well, fair enough, I guess. Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me."" And, after the monks refuse to accept any form of payment for their hospitality, the man leaves.One year later, to the day, the same man, driving the same car, at the same time of night, breaks down in front of the same monastery.Everything happens as it had the year before. The monks invite him in, feed him, let him spend the night, fix the car, and overnight, the man hears the same sound coming from within the monastery. Hearing it again after all this time, the man now lays awake all night. It’s as if the sound is calling out to him. By the time morning comes, one thing is clear: the man will never be satisfied until he knows what the source of the sound was.So in the morning he asks again. And again, the monks tell him that since he is not a monk, they cannot tell him.""Alright,"" he says, ""you’ve interested me. What do I have to do to become a monk?""""You have to go around the world,"" they reply, ""without using any type of vehicle that has an engine. And in your travels, you have to count the number of people you see. You do not have to count the number of people in the world— but you need to count the number of people you see, while you go around the world.""The man sets off. He begins traveling immediately after finishing breakfast. Since he cannot use a vehicle with an engine, he figures that his best bet is to use a bicycle to travel the land distances, but the bulk of his journey would happen using a sail boat.He plots his course, and then navigates it. And with every person he saw, he added to his count. Every person he passed while traveling on the road. Every person in every car that passed him. All the people in the port before he set sail. All the people in the port where he landed. And so on.Finally, after a great deal of time spent traveling and counting people, he arrives back at the monastery. His car is still parked there. He walks right past it without casting it a second glance, and he knocks on the door of the monastery.""Welcome home,"" a monk greets him.""I made the journey,"" the man says, ""I saw Four hundred and seventy nine thousand, seven hundred and sixty two people, including you.""""Excellent,"" says the monk, as he embraces the man and leads him into the monastery, ""then you are home. You are a monk now. And as such..."" the man pulls out a key which he carries on a necklace around his neck, ""you can find what you sought.""The monk hands the man the key and leads him to a wooden door. The door’s surface is worn, but strong. It has been the guardian of the source of the sound for a very long time. The man unlocks the door, and behind the door is a long hallway. Hundreds of yards long, so that it must go deep into the mountain that the monastery sits at the foot of. He begins to walk down it, then he starts to run. He’s almost there. He can hear the sound growing louder.At the end of the hallway is a large, steel door. The kind of door that would secure a bank vault. The monk— who the man had not heard running behind him— tells the man the combination. Turn right five times and land on 47. Turn left four times, land on 97. Right three times to 62. Finally, left twice, landing on zero.As he put in the combination he realized it was the same as the number of people he saw as he went around the world.The locking mechanism clicks and the vault door unlocks. The man turns the handle and pulls back, revealing another, darker hallway. Halfway down this hallway, it opens up into a cavern. But through the cavern, there is a well lit and well worn path— worn by the feet of all those who have seen the source of the sound. The sound, which was growing louder with ever step. He was so close.The man arrives at the end of the path. There was a round stone door— similar to the type of door that sealed Jesus’ tomb. The man goes to one side of the door and pushes with all the strength he has left just to make the door budge, but once he has it rolls the rest of the way to the side.Exhausted, the man now staggers into yet another, much shorter hallway which is only about fifteen yards in length. At the end of this hallway is a curtain. The man peels the curtain to the side, and is amazed to find out what was making the noise.But I can’t tell you what it was, because you’re not a monk.",2020-12-26 20:59:57,19,975,88,5124

Every morning, the guru returned to the cave to monitor the woman’s progress. In his hand, he carried a heavy wooden cane.

The guru would strike her over the head with his cane. This scenario repeated itself for months. One day the guru entered the cave, asked the same question, heard the same answer, and raised his cane to hit her in the same way, but the woman grabbed the cane from the guru, stopping his assault in midair. Relieved to end the daily beatings but fearing reprisal, the woman looked up at the guru. To her surprise, the guru smiled. ""Congratulations,"" he said, ""you have graduated.

When he went down to the kitchen, he saw half eaten cookies on the floor and broken glass bowl and Grandpa red faced and yelling while Grandma was trying to calm him down. ""What's going on?! "" Johnny asked. ""Nothing to worry dear!"" Said Grandma. ""Some animal broke into the house and tried to eat-""""Animal?!!"" Yelled Grandpa. ""It's not an animal! I swear to God when I catch that little.-"" ""Shush George."" Said Grandma. ""You're going to upset the kids. You go to bed, Johnny.  We'll talk in the morning.""The next morning, over breakfast, Johnny felt Gramps was still a bit grumpy. He ate his food , got up to leave while muttering he was going for a walk and he hoped one of those pesky little critters crosses his path. Johnny waited until he left and asked Grandma what it was all about. ""Well Johnny"" said Grandma. ""Your Grandpa is quite convinced it's not an animal. He thinks it's the magical little people of the forest"". ""What?!"" exclaimed Johnny and Julie.""Yeah. He is pretty sure it's a gnome or an elf or one of those things.""

It was Christmas Eve and Granny prepared a delicious meal. They had their full and were all sitting around the fire and talking when the topic came up again. ""I'm going to stay up tonight"" declared Gramps, while taking a sip of his whiskey.""Tomorrow is Christmas, George! Just get to bed and let's enjoy the holidays with the kids!""

It was 3 am. Johnny and Julie woke up startled with loud noises from downstairs. Glass breaking, Grandpa yelling and grunting, Grandma screaming ""George, please stop!"", another strange voice wailing clearly in agony.They quickly got out of bed, got dressed and ran down the stairs. Meanwhile the noise had died down. The scene that they came down to was surreal.Grandma was standing there with her mouth wide open, shaking and clearly very upset. There were broken glass and pots and pans strewn across the floor. Grandpa was standing on the other side of the room, breathing heavily, with a strange gleam in his eyes and staring at something on the floor. ""Merry Christmas, you little shit. That should teach you"" said Grandpa with an evil smile.Johnny and Julie ran around the table to see  what Grandpa was looking at. And behold, there was a little elf dragging himself across the floor towards the open door, whimpering, bloody all over. As they watched, the elf, crossed the doorstep, stood up shakily and staggered away into the night.Johnny and Julie couldn't believe their own eyes. ""What the hell happened?!'

The book was called ""main principles of humour"" and she was super invested in that book. At the last page was something called an anti-joke. It was explained that it is something that is not funny and that is the reason it becomes funny. So she started reading examples of an anti-joke and laughing out loud. A postman saw her laughing and said to her - ""do you want to hear the best anti-joke, that is so good it is bad again?"". ""No"" - she replied.

kk04kf,0,Byzarru,One day a man was walking through the forest when he encountered a goblin.,"The goblin shouted at the man and said: ""Foolish mortal, you trespass on sacred grounds! You know not the danger that hides within these hallowed woods!""The man happened to be Neil deGrasse Tyson, famed astrophysicist and general man of science.Neil responded simply, ""This is a public park,"" and to that the goblin let out an exasperated gasp and retorted, ""Well, I have a magical patch of dirt. I swore on my life to protect it.""Neil, bemused, responded, ""This is public property, you can't own any of it.""""BUT IT'S MINE! THE PATCH OF DIRT IS MINE!"" The goblin screeched back, his voice devolving into a hiss. ""And I will protect my patch of dirt! Since you cannot be persuaded, I will lay defenses to protect my patch of dirt!""""You, human, should not be able to pass these defenses, but, if you do... and you THREATEN MY PATCH OF DIRT, then... I will CURSE YOU!""The goblin disappeared suddenly as Neil dwelled upon the goblin's choice of words, musing the word ""defenses"" repeatedly as he continued his walk through the forest.Eventually, Neil came across a wall, stretching for miles and spanning the entire woods.The wall was made of burning bricks, unnaturally luminous and searing to the touch. Neil realized that the goblin was serious and this was the first defense he had laid.The wall was designed to be impassible but Neil overcame the obstacle with ease, as the wall was impassible only to goblins and was short enough for an average sized human to step over.Neil continued for another mile before reaching the next defense.This time, it was a deep chasm stretching for miles, cursed so anything that dipped below ground level would freeze instantly, and so unthinkably deep that anything that fell in would surely shatter at the bottom.The chasm was designed to be impassible but Neil overcame the obstacle with ease, as the chasm was impassible only to goblins and was narrow enough for an average sized human to step across.Neil continued for another hour before reaching the final defense.It was another wall, also spanning the length of the entire forest, but was this time merely invisible.The wall was designed to be impassible but Neil overcame the obstacle with ease by tripping over it; like the other defenses, it was designed for goblins and was so short that Neil did not even realize there was a wall at all.Neil continued for some time, wondering when he would find the next defense.He became more wary as he started to notice changes in the scenery. The trees were alien, bearing strange fruit that resembled a cow's udders. The leaves changed from shades of green to impossible shades of pink and blue and fantastic colors in between. Even the scent of the forest, the chill of the air, and the color of the late afternoon sky felt foreign.This development troubled Neil, but he remembered that as a man of science, he had a commitment to human knowledge and understanding and decided to press on.In minutes, Neil finally came to a clearing in the woods, which was dominated by a massive mound of dirt. Atop the mound was the goblin, thoroughly engrossed in eating one of the strange, succulent alien udder fruits.Neil watched for some time before the goblin looked up and screamed, ""YOU BREACHED MY DEFENSES! HOW DARE YOU?! YOU MUST NOT TRESPASS UPON MY PATCH OF DIRT! I PROMISE YOU WILL BE CURSED UNLESS YOU DARE RETURN TO THE FROM WHERE YOU CAME!""Offended by the goblin's threat, Neil pressed on and walked upon the patch of dirt for science.The goblin immediately threw the udder fruit to the ground, leaped up, and perched in a tree, ripping off a branch and fashioning it into a wand to focus the magic of the forest. He struggled with the branch but was able to cast his curse upon Neil before he was able to finish his crossing.Neil was gripped by a wave of energy and reeled from the pain, an overwhelming sensation, feeling as if his skin was evaporating from his body. The sensation was so exhausting that Neil blacked out.He woke up hours later, the forest now devoid of color as the world was bathed in moonlight. He was still in the clearing and could make out the udder-shaped fruits in the trees, but the goblin and the mound of dirt were gone.Neil had a dull pain throughout his entire body and knew that it was a result of the goblin's curse. Seeing the moon's reflection in a lake, he ran for the shore so that he may see his reflection.He looked at the reflection of his face, then at his hands, and at his reflection again before realizing that he had undergone a metamorphosis: Neil deGrasse Tyson was now green.His skin, eyes, hair, and even his internal organs had taken on a vibrant green color. When he returned home, he found that all of his clothes and furnishings had turned green as well.Neil never saw the goblin again and resumed his life as normal. He continued to give lectures and host television programs, though was frustrated by a new compulsion to only buy and receive green things. Critics took to calling him a ""little green man"" while his fans called him the ""green science guy."" His newfound color hardly had an effect on his career and he ultimately came to forget about his experience in the forest.This story was first envisioned a few years ago and until now was only known to a few friends due to its length. It is called ""The Greatest Joke in the World"" because, like all great jokes, it has a moral. To justify the joke's title, the moral of this particular story is the greatest moral of all, and is as follows:deGrasse is always greener on de udder side of defense.",2020-12-25 07:48:50,14,973,74,5547

kjxn1z,0,vanimations,A boy growing up on a farm was asked by his mother to do his chores before breakfast.,"He went outside to the chicken coop to gather the eggs but before collected them he decided to chase the chickens around briefly for fun.He then went to the pig pen with his bucket of leftovers to feed them. When he sees them approaching he decides to dump the bucket on their heads because he's still feeling frustrated by having to do his chores.Next, he goes to milk the cows. While he is milking the barn cat walks up and he aims the teat at the cat and delivers a stream of milk that sends the cat running.He returns to the house eager for the hearty breakfast he enjoys every morning. To his surprise, hit plate contains a single piece of toast and his glass has lukewarm water in it...nothing else is on the table. The boy asks his mom where his breakfast is and she explains that he would have had some eggs if he hadn't chased the chickens around the coop. She describes the tasty bacon and ham she would have cooked for him if he hadn't dumped the slop onto the head of the pigs and how he could have washed his meal down with some delicious milk if he hadn't sprayed the cat while milking.As he sat eating his single piece of toast and pondering his lesson about actions and consequences, his dad walks down the stairs and uses his foot to abruptly nudge the cat relaxing on the stairs out of his way and onto the floor a few steps down.The boy looks at his mom and asks, ""Do you want to tell him or should I?""",2020-12-25 04:32:45,18,272,85,1421

kjtfpi,0,thunkbunk,Jim's wife makes him get sober,"Jim was a bit of an alcoholic. A good enough guy but he couldn't hold his booze. Jim's wife, Becky, was just about tired of his shit and one night he comes home at 2am drunk as a skunk, stumbles to the kitchen and eats a whole pie. Then crawls to bed and pukes all over the new duvet cover, the mattress and Becky herself. The next day when Jim finally wakes up Becky is packing her bags. She tells him she can't stand his drinking and she's going to her mother's. Jim pleads with her and begs her and promises he'll quit drinking. Becky finally relents but swears that if Jim comes home drunk one more time she'll divorce him. All goes well for Jim and Becky for a while. Sober Jim is a good guy. He's thoughtful, shows up to work and even the boss has taken notice. A few weeks go by and things are still going great. On his way home from work one payday,  Jim passes his old favorite saloon. He takes a peek in and everything looks magical in the dusk light. You can hear a loud laugh or two above the murmur of the people inside. Glasses clink and ice is stirred behind the dark mahogany bar. Jazz piano plays quietly from a speaker somewhere . Jim thinks to himself that he could probably have one beer. One light beer and head home. Becky would be none the wiser and a beer sure would taste good on a hot summer evening. Jim goes inside and one beer turns into six and then whiskey. Soon enough Jim is shit-faced and pukes all over the front of his shirt. Down his jacket and tie and even on his pants. A true vomit apocalypse. Jim starts quietly weeping, then sobbing. The guy next to him feels sorry for the sack of crap and ask's what's wrong. Jim manges to say, between sobs,""my....wife...is...gonna...leave me."" The kind stranger says, ""No buddy, I've been there. What you do is stick $50 bucks in your jacket pocket. Tell the old lady that some drunk puked on you. But gave you money for dry cleaning. And then show her the cash.""Jim thinks thar sounds reasonable and heads home to face Becky. Jim walks in the door to Becky, hand on hi,  sees him covered in vomit and without a word heads to the attic to grab the suitcase. Jim slurs, ""Baby,  baby, baby. It's not what you think. Yes. I'll admit I did go to the bar. And I will admit that I had a couple of beers at the bar. I shouldn't have done that. It was wrong and I am sorry.  But this mess. This isn""t my fault."" As Jim gestures at the parade of puke on his clothes. Becky does not say anything and looks very doubtful.Jim continues drunkenly, ""there was a guy at the bar. Nice enough fella, but got way too drunk and he threw up. All over me."" As jim gestures at his ruined suit. Becky still looks suspicious but, after all she does love him, so she wanted to believe it. She continues to listen. Jim says, ""but like I said, he was a pretty good guy so he gave me $50 bucks to dryclean everything."" Jim reaches into his pocket and hands the money to Becky. Becky looks at the money and says, ""but Jim, there are two $50's here. That's $100 dollars.""Jim smiles broadly and whispers conspiratorially in the way of the truly intoxicated, ""ohhhhhhhhh yeahhhhh...I forgot to tell you. He also shit my pants.""",2020-12-24 21:59:25,6,607,30,3174

After many years he finds a theater where they are prepared to give him a chance to shine again. The director says, ""This is the most important part, and it has only one line. You walk on to the stage at the opening carrying a rose. You hold the rose to your nose with just one finger and thumb, sniff the rose deeply and then say the line: 'Ah, the sweet aroma of my mistress.'""The actor is thrilled. All day long before the play he's practicing his line over and over again. Finally, the time came. The curtain went up, the actor walked onto the stage, and using just one finger he delivered the line, ""Ah, the sweet aroma of my mistress.""The theater erupted, the audience was screaming with laughter and the director was steaming!

However, if the ear is instead in a down position, the next year will be full of misery and pain (like 2020).The tradition of checking on the gnu has been passed down from generation to generation, and it is very serious and exciting to be given the honor of carrying it out. Traditionally, the honor is passed down to whoever becomes of age.Eventually, Mary, a young teen, is given the honor of checking on the gnu that year. On the last day of the year, she excitedly rushes out to check on the animal. However, in her excitement, she forgot her keys to the barn, and is a minute late. She observes that the animal's ear is (wrongfully) in the down position. Gloomily, she predicts that the next year will be a dark and sad one. However, it turned out to be a very good year.The next week newspaper headline therefore read:""Mary Kriste Misses a Happy Gnu's Ear""",2020-12-24 18:26:23,14,184,66,988

kjph2l,0,Funandgeeky,This year in Heaven the Christmas celebration was also a costume party. Everyone dressed up.,"Many people came as movie characters, from Gandalf the Grey (and White) to Jason Bourne to Black Widow to Harry Potter. Alan Rickman went as Hans Gruber, which made St. Peter exclaim ""See, Die Hard IS a Christmas movie!"" St. Peter was dressed as the ""Fragile"" lamp from A Christmas Story. Moses showed up as Charlton Heston's version of himself, while Charlton Heston dressed up as an ape. Ruth Bader Ginsburg came as Hermione Granger. (Although she insisted that she was dressed as the book character, not the movie character, which explained the teeth.)There were also some great couple's costumes. Alex Trebek and Sean Connery dressed up as each other and re-enacted bits from the Celebrity Jeopardy sketches. The Wright brothers dressed up as the Super Mario Brothers. Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds came as Captain Kirk and Mister Spock. Prince dressed up as Dave Chappelle's version of Rick James and David Bowie came as ""Super Freakonomics."" Naturally, everyone was looking for the guest of honor. If anyone would have a fantastic costume, it would be Jesus.  However, try as they might, no one could figure out Jesus' costume among the multitudes of party guests. There were, of course, plenty of people who dressed as Jesus, and some wondered if Jesus had gone full meta. He didn't, but as it turned out Charlie Chaplin did dress up as Jesus and placed third in the Jesus Look-a-Like contest. Finally, as the party was drawing to a close, it was time for everyone to unmask. Joan of Arc was the one dressed as Bigfoot. Alan Turing was Predator. Richard Pryor was the Burning Bush. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, who had long since made up and become the best of friends, were the unicorn.  Eventually there was only one costume left.As Jesus pulled off the Matt Damon mask, everyone realized that Christ was Bourne on Christmas Day.",2020-12-24 16:59:23,15,317,92,1846

When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where. Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered. Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom. Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?""

kjlxs4,0,jvilliards036,"A long time ago, there were two rival kingdoms separated by a mountain range.","The kingdoms always tried to one-up each other at everything: wealth, food, and even the population. They encouraged people to have more babies and try to outgrow the other kingdom in terms of population.The problem was, however, that one of the kingdoms had an odd rule that no baby could have the same name as the other; each baby had to have a unique name. Otherwise, the family would be banished from the kingdom.This wasn’t really a problem until perhaps a decade later when people had run out of ideas to name their children. However, there was a legend that at the top of the mountain range that separated the kingdoms, there was a monk who had the ability to give unique names to anyone who came there.The people of the kingdom desperately tried to find ways to get up to the top. Every mountain in the range was snow-filled, extremely cold, and steep so it wasn’t an easy task.But after the banishment of about a hundred families, one person ended up finding a path to the top that was relatively safe. After that, more people started to climb up the mountain, reach the top, and meet the monk.The monk did everything they had hoped for: after the parents step in front of the monk, in mere seconds, the monk says a name that had never been heard before, yet was still beautiful.The monk kept doing this for centuries as even more people kept arriving at the top, asking for names.Alas, at the turn of a new century, the two kingdoms went to war, one that was so brutal that no person remained alive.For the next few centuries, the land was desolate and all flora and fauna faded away. That is, until some explorers arrived there as they were traveling throughout the lands to find places to settle and mine for precious materials.They saw how bad the land was, yet the saw the potential it had. So they brought in even more people to restore the land and build a settlement there. As decades and centuries passed, the settlement thrived - it enjoyed great agriculture, a healthy population, and an abundance of precious materials that allowed the population to discover new uses almost all the time.And as for the mountain range, the people discovered the legend of the monk from some records that they found at the base of one of the mountains.So, fittingly, they decided to name the mountain range, the Appellation Mountains.",2020-12-24 13:11:24,14,414,77,2337

kjijow,0,Ginger_Mammoth,A forest was in the process of being cut down,"The forest animals were concerned that their habitat was being destroyed so they consulted the oldest wisest tree in the forest on what they could do to save the forest. The wise tree thought about it and saidperhaps the bears can scare the loggers away. The bears snarled and charged the loggers to scare them. This worked initially, but then the loggers hired hunters and soon there were no bears left to scare them. The logging resumed and the forest animals returned to the wise tree for advice. The tree suggested that the birds swoop down and peck the loggers to disrupt their work day. This worked for a while until the loggers hired some falconers to hunt the birds. Soon there were not enough birds to halt their progress so the loggers resumed. At this point the loggers were getting very close to the wise tree, so the forest animals came back once more to see what the tree had to say. The tree suggested that all the squirrels and mice chew through the cables of their chainsaws and other equipment so that they could no longer cut down the trees. While this did slow them down, the loggers quickly switched to manual saws and axes and carried on. The day came where the loggers had reached the wise tree and chopped it down. Later that night the forest animals sadly visited the dying tree and asked one last time if there was anything they could do to save the forest. The tree let out a weak sigh and said ""I don’t know guy I am stumped",2020-12-24 09:51:11,10,268,45,1452

kjco2y,0,Horhay90,Young Paddy,"A young Irish man called Paddy wanted to buy a Christmas present for his new girlfriend. They hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived in Donegal and he lived in Kerry . Paddy consulted with his Sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality Gloves would strike the right note... not too Romantic and not too Personal. Off he went with his Sister to Marks and Spencer’s and they selected a dainty pair of Fur Lined quality, Leather Gloves. Paddy's sister bought a Pair of Sexy Knickers for herself at the same time. Marks and Spencer’s had a ""Free Gift Wrap Offer"" on as it was Xmas. But the Shop Assistant mixed up the Two Items, the Sister got the Gloves and Paddy unknowingly, got the Knickers. Good old Paddy, sent off his Gift Wrapped Present in a parcel with the following Letter. Dear Maggie, I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any, when we go out in the Evenings. If it had not been for my Sister, I would have chosen the Long Ones with the Buttons, but she wears Shorter Ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the Lady I bought them from, showed me the Pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any Marks. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little Bit Tight on Her. She also said that they Rub against her Ring, which helps keep it Clean. In fact she hasn't needed to Wash It, since she began wearing them. I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other Hands will Touch them, before I have a chance to see you again.When you take them off, remember to blow into them a little bit, because they will be naturally a little Damp from Wearing.??Just imagine how many times my Lips will Kiss them during the coming year.I hope you will Wear them for me on our Next Date.??All my love,Patrick.*P.S.

kj9g4z,0,MasterTony127,The tour of Communist Russia,"A couple toured Communist Russia shortly before the end of Communism there in the early 1990's. This couple was rather well off and wanted a tour guide as they explored the nooks and crannies of red Russia.After calling many Russian tour companies and interviewing many candidates, the couple finely decided on a top notch tour guide named Rudolph Vodkayevsky. The couple and Vodkayevsky instantly connected and things got even better as the interview proceeded. Turns out most of the things the couple enjoyed and liked Vodkayevsky ALSO enjoyed and liked. He also knew Russian cities and the Russian countryside like the back of his hand.The ONLY issue was that Vodkayevsky didn't like nicknames. He was adamant he be addressed as ""Rudolph"". NOT ""Rudy"". Not ""Rude"" and especially NOT ""Dolph"". Other than that one little hangup, Rudolph was the perfect tour guide. The couple understood and thought they could easily make their tour guide happy with the way they address him. Since he was the perfect choice their Russian tour could finally begin.First stop St. Petersburg and the Hermitage museum. The largest art museum in the world. Rudolph proved very knowledgeable not only in the history museum's contents but where everything was located as well. Shopping and dining also proved to be pure joy as Rudolph took them to the finest places. Five days of pure joy for the couple.Next stop Moscow with the same results. Rudolph knew all the schedules and locations of anything the couple wanted to enjoy.After many wonderful days of touring different Russian cities they decided they wanted to get a feel for the Russian countryside and had Rudolph arrange a hike. A long nature hike to leave early, bird watch and come back late. They left the hotel early and had an exhilarating hike to a beautiful location Rudolph knew about. A plateau with a beautiful river and mountains. After a few hours Rudolph warned the couple of bad weather and suggest they get back to the hotel. The couple knew Rudolph was right but begged him to stay another hour. Because the couple were paying him Rudolph allowed it under the condition they don't ask for more time at the end of the hour. The couple readily agreed and spent another hour at the plateau. At the end of the hour everyone got ready and started the long hike back to the hotel.On the way back it started precipitating HARD. So hard it was difficult to see and the couple formed a line with Rudolph leading the way.On the way the husband yells at Rudolph so he can hear him ""I'm uncomfortable with it snowing so hard.""Rudolph: Not snow. Is rain.The Man: I know what it is. It's SNOW.Rudolph: No. Is RAIN.They debate it for some time before the man turns to his wife.The Man: Is this snow or rain?The Wife: Rain.The Man: You KNOW it's snow. Why are you saying it's rain???The Wife: Because Rudolph, the Red knows rain, dear...",2020-12-23 22:18:35,5,496,28,2874

kj7y63,0,FPSCanarussia,My life ambition is to have a lot of karma on Reddit.,"Unfortunately, it is a hard job. I tried doing it alone first, leaving insightful comments and making quirky posts - but I had no luck. So I decided to ask for advice.First, I went to a wise guru who had a thousand karma. And I asked him, ""Oh wise guru, how do you have so much karma?""The guru told me the secret of his success. ""Though hard work, you shall gain. Put effort into each post, and redditors will reward you with karma.""And for a year, I worked hard. Every one of my posts was a masterpiece, one which took months to create, and each one got me a few hundred karma - until, at the end of the year, I had reached a thousand.But a thousand karma is still so little, so I turned to a noble knight who had ten thousand karma. And I asked him, ""Oh noble knight, how do you have so much karma?""The knight told me the secret of his success. ""Patience will get you far. Every post and every comment you create will earn you some karma. You only need to make more.""And for another year, I worked hard and with patience. I made hundreds of posts and thousands of comments across myriad subreddits, and though each only earned me a few measly points they added up - until, at the end of the year, I had reached ten thousand.But ten thousand karma is still so little, so I turned to a shrewd businessman who had a hundred thousand karma. And I asked him, ""Oh shrewd businessman, how do you have so much karma?""The businessman told me the secret of his success. ""Luck is what you need. Posts and comments cost little to create, so share them often. Even if most do not get noticed, a few will inevitably go viral.""And for another year, I worked hard, with patience, and luck. I shared thoughts, opinions, and random pictures across a hundred subreddits, and though most went unnoticed, some went viral - until, at the end of the year, I had reached a hundred thousand.A hundred thousand karma is a lot, and for a time, I was happy - until I came across a man by the side of the road with a million karma. My heart broken, I asked the man how he had gained so much karma.The man told me, ""Oh, I just left a few insightful comments and made a few quirky posts here and there.""I was stunned. ""And that got you a million karma?""He laughed. ""Well,"" he said, ""no. That got me a few dozen points at most. It's just the reason why I'm on Reddit in the first place.""""B-but..."" I stammered, pointing at his karma count.""Ah, that,"" he continued laughing, ""well, all I had to do was stay on Reddit for a year.

kj7esh,0,LennyLegend800,I went to the store to buy a Vacuum. (Long),"One day,  I went to the store to buy a Vacuum. There really wasn't any available except for one sitting in the corner. I bought it and the cashier told me that this vacuum was special. Not only can it do stuff like a normal vacuum could, it was so powerful that I could suck in animals whole.  I really wasn't up to looking anywhere else, so I bought it.  Later that day, I decided to give it a test run. I didn't believe him at first that the vacuum was so powerful, but as I was driving by, I saw a fire over by the Farm. I pulled over and the farmer came up to me.  ""Help! Help!"" the Farmer cried, ""My barn caught fire and all the animals are stuck inside!"".  The firefighters weren't there. so I took the chance to use my vacuum and help the innocent creatures.  I turned on the vacuum. First I tried the Cows. It didn't work. The cows burned up and died.  Next I tried the horses. That didn't work either, they all burned up and died.  Next the pigs, same thing.  Next the sheep, didn't work.  I tried one last time, this time on the lone donkey. Hopefully I can get at least one animal out of here before I burn up, too.  I pointed the vacuum at the donkey, and almost in an instant, the donkey got sucked into the vacuum!  I went outside and the farmer came up to me again.  ""It's a shame that the other animals died. But I just thank you for saving my one donkey, at least"". The Farmer said.   ""Yeah thanks, I tried using my vacuum, but I think i'm gonna return it because it really sucks ass.""

kj70qo,0,saketho,A joke about inflation.,"After spending years studying and perfecting his skills in the STEM fields, a scientist decided to finally put his experiment to the test. He had a great interest in the science of cryogenics - freezing a human being, so that they may freed at a later time in order to preserve the person's age, and basically allowed them to time travel. But, like any individual, the man also realised that it was pointless to just run a simple science experiment. What's there to gain apart from knowledge? Why not make it a situation where one could gain knowledge AND money? If he could freeze himself, he would be able to take advantage of inflation!So, with advice from many highly trained colleagues at his university, the man made a list of places to invest his money. Some stocks, some bonds, some plots of land, a house, an apartment, and so on.The day had come, and he placed himself into the machine. His employees froze him, and followed his specific instructions.30 years later, the employees (who have grey hair now), came back to the machine, and unlocked the doors, allowed the man to thaw out and return to room temperature. The experiment was a success! The man had barely aged! He looked the youngest in the room!But before any of his employees could have a chance of talking to him, the man brushes them aside, and sprints to his desk to find his phone. Naturally, what he wanted to find out first was how much money he had made.He called his lawyers and brokers. They picked up and said, ""Wow Jimmy! You've made it! Don't you worry, we took care of your assets the best we could, and guess what? You're a millionaire! You're a millionaire many times over!"" He proceeded to explain which assets rose, and how much they rose by, which companies succeeded, etc. The man is thrilled! He is ecstatic about being a millionaire! But before he can say anything more to his lawyer, the operator interrupts the call and says, ""Your first 3 minutes are up. That'll be $450,000 for the next 3 minutes.""",2020-12-23 19:38:46,4,356,23,1996

kj3qzf,0,Street_Attorney_9367,What do you guys think is the best storyline out of the two potential versions of my book?,"1. Tory scientistsIt was another lunar eclipse at 10 Downing Street. The scientists gathered, not much by curiosity, but by official duty, to witness another crossing of paths between two large objects. Boris aligned his mouth with Dominic's butthole for the 56th time in his life. It also happened to be his 56th birthday - though they assured us that was another coincidence. The joining occurred. SAGE watched Boris's vitals as Dominic advised him through what they described as their 'mutual way of understanding each other'.2. Jam that hamIt was a dark wintry day. Dreary is the right term. Storms ensued outside whilst David decided it was time for his night cap. He left his library to reach for his whisky. He took the finest whisky from his locker and poured a splash into his cup. David felt troubled by the warmth so decided to go for some ice. He walked to his american fridge freezer he got at a higher tariff and opened the door to see the pig's head he left for his little fun evening he planned tomorrow. Desire and rage rushed over David. He couldn't help himself but to give it a go before the boys come over tomorrow. To see if he still has what it takes.David left the room and sodomised the pig. ""PSYCH GAY BOY"" Boris yelled. ""ITS ME"". David looked without concern. ""I know""3. The Thespian and the BeastBoris looked upon the face of his thespian wife. Admittedly she grew tired of faking romance with the fat cunt. Boris had been at home more than they agreed in the job description and covering up boris's gay exploits grew closer to exposure than planned. ""Stop it. You have to stop seeing David"". Boris frowned.  His dishevelled haircut made it hard for him to be taken seriously, but Carrie knew this time not to poke the pig. ""I will see who I want, Carrie. You know this"". Carrie took a deep breath as her look grew with concern. ""This is not how I envisaged my 30s Boris. You promised me pimms on deck chairs"". ""Well touche to that. I didn't think I'd be dressing up like a pig to get David's fancy again"", Boris chuckled.Let me know. Thanks!",2020-12-23 16:20:20,18,375,90,2070

The old gentleman nodded his head yes politely, softly apologized, and went about his chores.A short time later, the old gentleman heard someone screaming in absolute terror – coming from where he’d told the officer not to go. He looked over at the pasture and saw the officer running for his life, chased by a very angry bull. With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it appeared likely that the policeman would be gored by the bull’s horns before he could reach safety.Realizing the horrible danger that the policeman was in, the old gentleman ran to the field’s fence as fast as he could, determined to do whatever he could to help. Reaching the edge of the pasture, the old gentleman quickly climbed to the top of the fence, waving his arms frantically and screamed at the very top of his voice, ""Your badge, officer, show him your BADGE!""",2020-12-23 08:42:42,5,296,20,1660

Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah!!"", not a single one could shout ""Truck""!",2020-12-23 08:10:00,5,177,32,1086

kirzu5,0,hayeshilton,"One particular Christmas season a long time ago, Santa was getting ready for is annual trip, but there were problems everywhere","Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed Santa even more.When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More stress.Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked, and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. So, frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum.When he went to the cupboard, he discovered that the elves had hidden the liquor, and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider pot, and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw end of the broom.Just then the doorbell rang, and irritable Santa trudged to the door. He opened the door, and there was a little angel with a great Christmas tree.The angel said, very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't it a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?""Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree.",2020-12-23 05:12:49,21,249,127,1338

The first room is big, with a few hundred people standing in piles of shit up to their waists. Other than that, nothing else is happening. They all seem to be having small talk, like they are in some kind of cocktail party, all be it, a boring cocktail party. The man tells the demon, ""Uh, maybe we can check out the next room.""The demon takes him to the next room, and the man is disgusted. This room is huge, with thousands of people in it. There is excrement piled so high, all he sees of the people are just their heads. Thousands and thousands of heads. No one is speaking. They all seem to be trying to keep their heads as far from the crap as possible. The smell, compared to the first room is atrocious. The man, cringing, says, ""No, definitely not.""The demon smiles and takes him to the last room. This one is smaller, much smaller. There are a few dozen people in it. The shit is only up to their knees. They all are drinking coffee or smoking a cigarette. They are all smiling, telling each other stories, and pretty much acting as if they at a family get together. The man smiles and tells the demon, "" This isn't so bad. I'll take this one."" The demon asks if he is sure, looking confused. The man says yes, and walks down the stairs to the bottom of the room. Another demon asks him if he wants a cup of coffee or a cigarette. He chooses the coffee. He's satisfied that he picked the right room to remain in for all eternity. Up the stairs, he notices a person who must be the Devil enter the room. He's completely red, a good 7 feet tall, with giant horns on his head. He's holding a clipboard, tapping his teeth with a pen, and pretty much ignoring everything around him but what's on the clipboard. He stands there for a few minutes, checking his watch every so often. Then, with the clearing of his throat, and voice that eminates from air around them, to the walls surrounding them, even to the crap underneath them, the Devil says, ""Okay, everyone, break times over!

As the US contingent neared the spaceship a broadcast was sent out by the aliens that said, ""This is Progongon Klopklepeux, I am the leader of the Vodeux Chjis Clan from White Dwarf GD362. We are friendly visitors to all people of Earth. We have absorbed communication and information data from all areas of Earth and want to  request a meeting with your President, Donald Trump.Within a matter of seconds Progongon Klopklepeux transported himself and President Trump from their current locations to the Roswell Command Center. As soon as Trump arrived he told Progongon Klopklepeux how amazing it was to be transported from Washington D.C. to Roswell within seconds. Trump told Progongon Klopklepeuxthat he had proposed the Instant Transport idea to the scientists and technology experts of the United States but they were all a bunch of mental midgets and couldn't devise a way to transport people.Progongon Klopklepeux introduced himself and explained to President Trump that there was 1,234,567 people from White Dwarf GD362 and they had identified Earth, as a possible settlement.Trump said, ""You are lucky you came to me. I have the best land and the best buildings throughout Earth. You will really need my help to settle because I am by far the smartest person on Earth. Half the people on the Planet are idiots that will do whatever I say and the other half are all just jealous that I am so smart and powerful.""Progongon Klopklepeux asked about Earth's difficulty with COVID-19. He was going to offer to eradicate the virus, but Trump quickly stopped him. Trump said, ""COVID-19 is nothing, it is like a cold to us. I had COVID-19 and recovered faster than any other person on Earth. I assembled a team and we created a vaccine in record time. It is another disaster that I saved the Earth from.""Trump then asked Progongon if they had women traveling within the group. Again, Progongon was about to answer but Trump interrupted him and said, ""All the women on Earth are in love with ""The Trumper."" Beautiful, ugly, fat, bitchy, all of the women throw themselves at me. I can set you up with as many women as you want. Just like my good friend Putin does for me when I am in Russia.The exchange between Progongon Klopklepeux and President Trump continued for about 6 more hours. Each time Progongon asked a question President Trump emphasized how important he would be for the Vodeux Chjis Clan's survival. Progongon finally said he had to speak to the Vodeux Chjis Clan's leadership council. He immediately transported himself back to the spaceship. Upon his return he immediately summoned the travel crew.Each of you told me we were landing on Earth but I believe there has been a mistake and we landed on Uranus. I want you to immediately recalibrate our system and recheck all data to pinpoint our location.The crew left and quickly returned with the data. Progongon, all systems are functioning properly and everything confirms we are on Earth. Progongon, Why would you believe we landed on Uranus and not Earth.Progongon was at a loss for words. Finally he said, ""I just assumed we had to be on Uranus because President Trump is, by far, the biggest asshole I have ever met.",2020-12-23 02:58:30,4,565,24,3327

At this bar they have a contest. On the bar counter is a large jar filled with 100s of dollars, and next to it is a basket of lemons. When asked the bartender will say the same exact story; ""First you put $100 into the jar, then you pick a lemon, next I squeeze your chosen lemon, and finally you squeeze the same lemon. IF you happen to get 1 more drop of juice, then you win the jar; however, if you don’t, you put another $100 into the jar.""After a few thousand dollars had been lost throughout the night, the small man heads up to the bar. He wiggles and climbs a barstool and puts a crisp $100 bill into the jar.After the laugher stopped the bartender asked him ""Are you sure? You can take your money back.""  The man insisted and handed the bartender a lemon from the basket. ""Ok,"" says the bartender and squeezes it with all of his might. Then he sets it down next to the man’s notebook and says, ""Ok, it’s your go.""The man looks at the lemon, looks at the jar, the bar, the bartender, the furniture, then the other patrons, and finally the sock of liquors. The man gets out the calculator, makes some inputs, writes in his notebook and finally picks up the lemon. The man turns it over a few times and squeezes it in his tiny hand and he didn’t get just one drop, nor did he get two, or three, or four. He got seven additional drops of juice. As he starts to collect up the money, the bartender asks, ""I gotta know, are you some kinda wizard, sorcerer, or mage or something?""The small man cracks a smile and says, ""Sorry no, I work for the IRS.""",2020-12-22 19:39:23,6,330,22,1706

She came across a church settled near the top of a mountain far away from civilization, and decided to ask for them to lend hospitality to her. A nun greeted her at the entrance when she approached the church, and lead her inside. There, she was given food, water, and shelter for the night. ""You are free to roam and explore this church"" the nun told her. ""You are our guest and may do as you please. However, you aren’t to enter the basement under ANY circumstances.""""Why not,"" asked the traveler, confused. ""What’s down there?"" ""I would tell you,"" the nun spoke slowly with her head down, ""but you’re not a nun."" The traveler thought the nuns demeanor was strange, but brushed it off. When going to her bed for the night, the traveler passed by the basement. She heard strangle sloshing noises, like a damp rag, followed by the sound of a feral animal crying in pain. Disturbed, she found a nun in the church. ""What the hell is going on in that basement,"" she asked the nun. ""I would tell you,"" the nun said, ""but you’re not a nun.""""If I become a nun, will I be able to find out what’s in that damn basement,"" asked the traveler, frustrated. ""I mean, I guess so,"" the nun shrugged. ""But are you really willing to put in a lifetime worth of commitment just to know what’s in the basement?"" The traveler nodded eagerly. Curiosity was ripping her to shreds.So began her training. For many long years she prayed, preformed rituals, and learned the word of the Lord. Her connection with God strengthened, but so did her flaming need to know what the FUCK was in that basement. After long years of hard work, she finally earned her title as a nun.""Since you are now a nun,"" a nun and the church told her, ""it’s about time I show you what’s in the basement. But first, you must pass a test of your faith. Tell me, which saint saw a flaming and winged figure in the sky when receiving the stigmata?"" ""Why, St, Francis of Assisi of course,"" the traveler replied confidently.""Excellent. Next question, name a female saint who is not a doctor of the church.""""St. Joan of the Arc, naturally.""""Wonderful. Finally, who was the second Pope?""""St. Linus. Sister, may I ask how this is a test of my faith?""""I was just messing with you. Come now, I’ll show you the basement. I know the curiosity has been troubling your heart.""Finally, after years and years of hard work, the traveler, now nun, was going to discover what was in the basement.

Why not the 100 dollar bill?""The man replies: ""Because the apple is tasty!"" and bites into the apple.The doctor asks again: ""But why do you not want the 100 dollar bill?""The man says ""Because I do not think you will actually give me a 100 dollar bill!""The doctor then slides over the 100 dollar bill to the man. ""Now you have both. How do you feel?""The man stares at the 100 dollar bill for a second, then gives a huge smile and picks it up.""I love 100 dollar bills, they're so much more tasty than apples!""The man then tears into the 100 dollar bill with his teeth as the doctor tries to wrestle it out of his hands.""I knew it, you didn't want me to have the 100 dollar bill!""",2020-12-22 07:23:17,10,194,41,1011

We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""""No problem, just let me in,"" says the senator.""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""""There's no need! I want to be in Heaven,"" says the senator.""I'm sorry, but we have our rules."" And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator, the doors open, and he rides the elevator down, down, down. When the doors open again, the senator finds himself in the middle of a beautiful green golf course. In the distance is a club, and standing infront of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.Everyone is very happy and in formal dress. They run to greet him, and they reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar.Also present is the Devil, who is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that, before the senator realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up, up, up, and the door reopens in Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.So 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by, and St. Peter returns.""Well, you've spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now, you must choose where you want to spend eternity.""He reflects for a minute and then answers, ""Well, I would never would have thought it, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better satisfied in Hell.""So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator, and down, down, down he goes into Hell. Now, the doors of the elevator open, and he is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. And it's hot, hot, hot, and the odor is just horrible.Sweltering hot. Hot and miserable. The Devil comes over to him and smoothly lays his arm around his shoulder.""I don't understand,"" stammers the senator. ""The day before I was here, and there was a golf course and club, and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a great time. Now all there is is a wasteland full of garbage, and my friends look miserable.""The Devil looks at the senator, smiles, and says, ""Yesterday we were campaigning.

khwxsg,0,TOReddical,The Monk,"(Idk what the hell this is but it made a few people I know laugh and I improvised it on the spot. More of an anti-joke?)So a Tibetan Monk one day leaves his monastery to explore the city of Los Angeles so as to observe the modern Western lifestyle. He is amazed by the towering steel buildings, the speeding vehicles, the energy all around him. He finds himself walking into a bar, and strangely enough, no one else commented on his presence. He sits down at the bar, and the bartender asks what he'd like to drink. ""I do not drink alcohol."" The bartender nods and hands him a glass of water, which the Monk thanks him profusely for. The bartender asks ""What brings you here?"", to which the Monk responds ""My legs."" The bartender laughs but the Monk is completely stone-faced. He and the bartender talk about life, the purpose of it, what makes it special, and what an ideal life should be like. The Monk vows against materialism or attachment, and swears himself to a simplistic and humble lifestyle, while the Bartender believes one should try to live life to the fullest, make change, and seek individual happiness. Despite disagreeing, the Monk and the Bartender respect eachothers opinions. As the Monk leaves, he looks back, realizing the bar is empty. ""How peculiar. Perhaps it is a sign.""As the Monk spent his days exploring the city, and trying to adjust to (but still stay separate from) the urban lifestyle, he decided to see what humanity had accomplished, and visits and museum. He sees the immaculate reconstructions of ancient life, the restorations and intricate analyses of historical sites, as well as how the world came to be. He was impressed, and while curious did not understand the appeal of knowing such things or caring for them, unsure of their impact. The museum, too, was completely empty, however once the Monk noticed this, a Guide approached him. Spoke to him about the processes and planning that went into each of these discoveries and the incredibly amount of thought and effort into uncovering the secrets of a world that was the same as our's, but completely different.The Guide left shortly after the Monk asked the point of it all, how it impacts life, and how it impacts the future. The Monk seemed alienated, trying to figure out how it relates to what he understood about life. How this energetic and expanding environment constantly accumulated more information, more data, and overly and unnecessarily complex web of information and emotion, almost disgustingly oversaturated. The Guide simply said ""There will be a moment once you realize the beauty of it all. But until then, keep looking until you find that moment."" before leaving. The Monk sought him out but could not find him anywhere in this crowded city,The Monk decided to visit a psychiatrist so as to help him better understand and work through this crisis. He spent days trying to understand this complete shift in lifestyles and perspectives. Over the course of these days he assimilated more to the lifestyle, though still being completely confounded by it. He then decided to explore what this society has created in the form of art, and decided to visit an art gallery.He was enamored by the both the intricacy and simplicity of the display pieces. Portraits, sculptures, sketches, carvings, paintings. Even everyday objects were canvases for art, and it was then when the Monk realized the meaning of it all. The connections, the webs, the branching paths and complexities of this modern lifestyle. Each strand had several dimensions to it, and what the Monk previously saw as unnecessary, foolish, naive, and selfish, he suddenly found fascinating. The Monk re-thought everything that had happened since he arrived, even everything that happened throughout his life. Instead of being visited by another guiding figure or helper of some sort, the Monk, while wandering aimlessly having an epiphany, came across a beautiful painting. A painting of himself.The painting was immaculate and had captured every detail of the Monk perfectly, stunningly realistic. It was as if it had a life of it's own, and it moved exactly how and when the Monk did, almost a reflection of his inner self. It was as if he had been trapped in the magnificent, shining work of art. He walked up to it, and touched the painting, and the painting of himself seemed to touch the exact same spot. Suddenly, the Monk could see everyone around him in the Gallery, though they still all seemed to ignore him. He greeted every single one of them with glee, and immediately decided to heat to his psychiatrist.""I've figured it out! The meaning of it all... I finally und-"" The Psychiatrist cut the Monk off.

Apparently, I wasn't getting my Nacho Cheese goodness without an incident. I didn't want to hurt an old lady, but she started crying. ""Jeremy! Jeremy! I love you Jeremy!""Ok. By now, the vast majority of Kroger is watching. Then, she falls down on the floor screaming and crying.I was just like ""Lady. I'm sorry but I'm not your kid. I just want my Cheetos and I'm out of here.""And she was putting on a huge show. She grabbed ahold of me and asked if I could tell her I loved her one last time. She wouldn't let go.

The fellow proposes that they continue their discussion over drinks at his place.  The woman agrees.They arrive at his apartment, and the woman is genuinely pleasantly surprised to see that, unlike a lot of bachelor pads, the apartment is tastefully furnished.They sit on the couch and have a few drinks.  He leads her to the bedroom and she is even more pleasantly surprised to see that one wall of the bedroom is completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddy bears on three shelves.  It's obvious that he has taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them. She's immediately touched by the amount of thought he put into organizing the display.There are small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf.She finds it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears. She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but doesn't mention this to him.They have a few more drinks and continue talking. After awhile, she finds herself thinking, ""Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one! Maybe he could be the future father of my children?""She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips.He responds warmly. They continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her onto the bed.  They rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.She is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known.After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow.The woman rolls over, gently Strokes his chest and asks coyly,'Well, how was it?'The guy opens q drawer on his nightstand, pulls out a little black book, consults a few pages, does some rapid calculations and says:""You can have a bear from the bottom shelf.""",2020-12-21 12:46:53,3,351,17,2008

He brings Murphy into the bedroom with his wife and hands him a tea towel, telling him to stand in the corner and flap the tea towel so that his wife will remain cool. Murphy is confused but goes along with it. Jimmy gets into bed and gets started while Murphy flaps away in the corner. An hour goes by - nothing, and Murphy's hands are getting tired. Finally Murphy suggests they swap places, to see if that helps. Jimmy and his wife agree, so Murphy gets into the bed and Jimmy flaps the towel. Within five minutes Jimmy's wife is screaming in pleasure with the most intense orgasms she has ever had, and within ten minutes they're both flopped on the bed, exhausted.Jimmy walks up to Murphy, triumphant.

Little did the fly know, there was a very hungry fish beneath it looking for some lunch. The only problem was that the fly was just a few inches too far above the surface of the water, so the fish had to wait for the fly to come down before it could jump to get it.Unfortunately, the fish was so caught up in waiting for the fly to move, that it did not notice the grizzly bear wading through the water. The bear had spotted the fish, but the fish was just a little too deep to get, so the bear decided to wait until the fish came up, so it could grab its meal.Meanwhile, on the riverbank sat a hunter and his faithful feline companion, who had been wandering through the woods all day, when the hunter spotted the largest grizzly bear he had ever seen. If the bear moved down just a touch, the hunter would have the perfect shot to kill it and take it home.While waiting for the bear to move, the hunter munched quietly on a few crackers he had been saving all day. Unbeknownst to him, his crumbs had attracted a small mouse, who was frantically scurrying about trying to get all of the scraps without being noticed.But it was too late for the mouse. The hunter’s cat had seen the mouse and was stalking it patiently. The cat knew that if the hunter fired his gun, the mouse would run away, directly towards the cat.The mouse paused, sensing danger, and the entire forest came to a standstill. The cat was waiting for the mouse, the hunter was waiting for the bear, the bear was waiting for the fish, and the fish was waiting for the fly. All that could be heard was the flow of the river and the soft buzzing of the clueless fly.And then it happened. The fly buzzed its way down right to the surface of the water. The fish jumped, mouth open wide in anticipation of the fly. The bear, seeing the fish move, lunged with paws outstretched, exposing its broadside to the eager hunter. The hunter seized the moment and fired his gun at the bear with a deafening sound that filled the forest. The mouse, terrified, took off, trying its best to escape the noise, but in its confusion, the mouse ran away from the cat towards the river. The cat, startled by the difference in its plan, scrambled after the mouse, not realizing how close the river was.

khhxc0,0,TrueGarden4821,The Twelve Thank You Notes Of Christmas,"Dec 25My dearest darling Edward,What a wonderful surprise has just greeted me! That sweet partridge, in that lovely little pear tree; what an enchanting, romantic, poetic present! Bless you, and thank you.Your deeply loving,EmilyDec 26Beloved Edward,The two turtle doves arrived this morning, and are cooing away in the pear tree as I write. I'm so touched and grateful!With undying love, as always,EmilyDec 27My darling Edward,You do think of the most original presents! Who ever thought of sending anybody three French hens? Do they really come all the way from France? It's a pity we have no chicken coops, but I expect we'll find some. Anyway, thank you so much; they're lovely.Your devoted EmilyDec 28Dearest Edward,What a surprise! Four calling birds arrived this morning. They are very sweet, even if they do call rather loudly - they make telephoning almost impossible - but I expect they'll calm down when they get used to their new home. Anyway, I'm very grateful, of course I am.Love from EmilyDec 29Dearest Edward,The mailman has just delivered five most beautiful gold rings, one for each finger, and all fitting perfectly! A really lovely present! Lovelier, in a way, than birds, which do take rather a lot of looking after. The four that arrived yesterday are still making a terrible row, and I'm afraid none of us got much sleep last night. Mother says she wants to use the rings to ""wring"" their necks. Mother has such a sense of humor. This time she's only joking, I think, but I do know what she means. Still, I love the rings.Bless you,EmilyDec 30Dear Edward,Whatever I expected to find when I opened the front door this morning, it certainly wasn't six socking great geese laying eggs all over the porch. Frankly, I rather hoped that you had stopped sending me birds. We have no room for them, and they've already ruined the croquet lawn. I know you meant well, but let's call a halt, shall we?Love,EmilyDec 31Edward,I thought I said NO MORE BIRDS. This morning I woke up to find no more than seven swans, all trying to get into our tiny goldfish pond. I'd rather not think what's happened to the goldfish. The whole house seems to be full of birds, to say nothing of what they leave behind them, so please, please, stop!Your EmilyJan 1Frankly, I prefer the birds. What am I to do with eight milkmaids? And their cows! Is this some kind of a joke? If so, I'm afraid I don't find it very amusing.EmilyJan 2Look here, Edward,This has gone far enough. You say you're sending me nine ladies dancing. All I can say is, judging from the way they dance, they're certainly not ladies. The village just isn't accustomed to seeing a regiment of shameless viragos, with nothing on but their lipstick, cavorting round the green, and it's Mother and I who get the blame. If you value our friendship, which I do (less and less), kindly stop this ridiculous behavior at once!EmilyJan 3As I write this letter, ten disgusting old men are prancing up and down all over what used to be the garden, before the geese and the swans and the cows got at it. And several of them, I have just noticed, are taking inexcusable liberties with the milkmaids. Meanwhile the neighbors are trying to have us evicted. I shall never speak to you again.EmilyJan 4This is the last straw! You know I detest bagpipes! The place has now become something between a menagerie and a madhouse, and a man from the council has just declared it unfit for habitation. At least Mother has been spared this last outrage; they took her away yesterday afternoon in an ambulance. I hope you're satisfied.Jan 5Sir,Our client, Miss Emily Wilbraham, instructs me to inform you that with the arrival on her premises at 7:30 this morning of the entire percussion section of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and several of their friends, she has no course left open to her but to seek an injunction to prevent you importuning her further.

khhunt,0,RASGAS23,Nate the Snake (Long),"There once was an island in the middle of the ocean, shaped somewhat like a dog bone, with two populated ends separated by a long narrow strip of land with a highway connecting the two ends of the island. Oddly enough, the entire island was held up from sinking into the ocean by a big lever, which sat in the very middle of the island, in the median of the highway. The land was so narrow that there was barely room for the highway, with no shoulder on either side, and just enough room for the lever in the median. Everyone knew If this lever was ever pulled the entire island would sink. This island also had a very old, very friendly snake named Nate, who was the unofficial mascot of the island. He was well known and loved by all the islanders, and was very old. One day, a man was driving from one end to the other, and as he was nearing the middle of the island he saw something in the middle of the road. As he got closer he realized it was Nate, crossing the road. He started to swerve into the other lane, to avoid running over Nate, but realized he was coming up on the lever, and if he swerved he would sink the entire island, killing everyone. At the last second, he made the fateful decision to... run over Nate, killing him instantly. As he drove away he looked in the mirror and saw the dead snake, smushed in the middle of the road, shrugged his shoulders, and muttered ""Better Nate than lever""",2020-12-21 06:55:32,4,270,21,1412

If he doesn’t have anything she wants a divorce.Not knowing what to do, he rushes to the family Dr., and when he arrives, he frantically begins to tell the Dr what the problem is. The husband says that if I don’t do something to change things up in the bedroom by the time my wife gets home for work, she will leave me. The doctor says that he’s not a sex therapist but will give a little advice about what spiced things up in his bedroom with his marriage. The Dr tells him that his wife will lay naked with her legs spread, and he’ll toss grapes, and when one is in or near, he’ll go up and lick it out—making sure to spend a little extra time in the process. When he’s done fulfilling her needs he’ll pop a viagra get hard as the Washington Monument and his wife will take donuts and play ring toss. When a donut goes around she will nibble it off and finish him off in the process. The husband extremely excited says thank you and I think you have something to save my marriage.  The Dr exclaims this isn’t medical advice; it is just one guy talking to another. The husband doesn’t care. He feverishly shakes his hand and rushes home.He gets the bed ready, puts out candles, makes a fancy dinner and soft music to set the mood. During the process of getting everything prepared for the big night ahead, his wife calls and says she is on her way home and what he will do about their marriage. He says that he has the key to save their marriage and is all set but realizes that he forgot the most important things. He asks if she minds stopping at the market for two things. Reluctantly she says sure, what do you need?Could you pick up a box of Cheerios and 4-5 cantaloupes?",2020-12-21 05:29:53,11,358,60,1851

khfbw9,0,TrueGarden4821,My job is so fucking unbelieveable.,"I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",2020-12-21 04:09:14,6,300,35,1643

khb6ku,0,ThomBraidy,There once was a man,"There once was a man - an old man - weathered and weary from spending the past 60 years of his life as a man of the sea.He had survived it all: war, weather, business. He had seen just about every major body of water known to man. The seven seas, the fours oceans, the great lakes and nearly a thousand more.  Rumor had it he had sailed the 100 longest rivers on the planet.There were rumors of his heroics, too. As a young man the local newspapers in coastal New England wrote about how he saved 17 soldiers lost at sea due to a hurricane.  The cute thing was, he had just turned 11.  The Navy tried to enlist him on the spot (and eventually he did serve) but he also knew that being out on the water offered more potential than just saving people. He could use his navigation abilities to transport goods for lots of money.  He could fish, maybe even illegally as the years went on, who knows.Every so often he would return to the town he grew up in, where he first learned to sail.  He yearned for the days of his youth when he could freely sail without obligation.  At first the locals would take note of his ship being in port.  They'd cheer for him to come to land, let them but him a beer. Even the paparazzi showed up once or twice. Occasionally he obliged but mostly he would just stay on his ship, getting some rest for the new day ahead.As he finally achieved financial independence and began his retirement, he decided to stay for a few nights in his home port.  He moseyed on up the coast and snuggled into his slip.  Of course, long gone were the days of cheering crowds or flashing cameras, and the old man relished in his memory of his moderate fame. Nevertheless, he had enjoyed his life and looked forward to the rest of it. At daybreak, he would sail, he would sail freely on the waters he knew oh so well.What started as a long weekend turned into a summer-long affair,  He had almost forgotten how much fun it was to sail without a sale on the line, and considered if he might be having his very finest aquatic moments yet. In his seventies!One day, the old man realized he needed some supplies, and stepped ashore. He headed into town, to the local hardware store, and began collecting his needed items.  As he was checking out, the cashier gave him a knowing smile.  She was an aging woman, tired from a summer dealing with tourists and their bratty children making a mess in the toy aisle. A working man was a sight for sore eyes.The old man blushed, and tried to think of clever thing to say. ""Thanks, I'll have my stuff now"" is what came out.  Woof. It had been a while. ""OH! um, yes sir. Best of luck, sir."" She replied, giggling. The old man was a little flustered, a little unsure of himself, and hesitated to respond. She continued, ""I think I remember you...you..youre the sailor, right?""""Um. Well, I am a sailor."" he replied.""No no you know what I mean.  You're.. whats your name. You rescued those men- er...boys - all those years ago. I... think we went to school together.""The old man was stunned. Well, maybe he shouldnt be so stunned, it is the town he grew up in, but he certainly was surprised and charmed.  After all these years, hardly stepping foot on land, and he was recognized as a hero within an hour by a random stranger.  He eventually found his words and asked her out on a date the following night.They met at the same time, same place, just as her shift was ending. They had a marvelous evening of conversation, food, and wine. As the night carried on, they began to wander down toward the local marina.  There was a big beautiful moon that night, and there is no better place to see a big beautiful moon than right on the water.  They made their way onto the old mans ship, and looked up at that great big wheel of cheese in the sky.""Well I have to say, I don't know how you did it. 60 years on the water, and its not like this boat has a ton of space.  Do you even have a bed?"" the old woman asked, clearly hinting that she was feeling amorous that evening. The old man picked up what she put down, and took her down below to his bed.""Wow, there is not a lot of room here for two people. How have you managed to date all these years?""""Well,"" the old man replied, ""the truth is, I haven't managed to date very often over the years. But, I don't know if I'd say its the bed's fault. It's a comfy enough bed for me, and I dated a few women while I was stationed during the war. But ultimately, I've been most comfortable just alone and at sea.""This time, the old woman didn't know what to say. She stared at the moon, hoping for a kiss.""Plus,"" the old man continued, ""I can just flip my legs up over my head and deepthroat myself when I need to cum.""",2020-12-20 22:44:52,5,910,20,4700

The other polar bears rolled their eyes and told Jerry to leave if he thought there was someplace better. ""I’m going south"" said Jerry. ""See you suckers later"". And he left to find a better home. After weeks of travel, Jerry finally arrived to a place where there was no snow. Astonished, he came to a clearing where he found a river that was not frozen and it was filled with fish. ""This is it!"" he said aloud. ""This is paradise!"".""Isn’t it great?"" said another voice. Jerry turned around and standing there was a brown bear. ""We have a wonderful home here. You are more than welcome to stay"" said the brown bear. ""No thanks"" said Jerry. And he turned and left back to the north pole. When he got back to the north pole, the other polar bears crowded around him and asked him what he saw. ""Did you find some place better"" they asked. ""Well"" said Jerry, ""I found a place where there wasn’t any snow and there were rivers filled with fish"". ""My god"" said the other polar bears. ""Why the hell did you come back?""""Well"" said Jerry, ""it all seemed pretty great. But then this bear came out of the woods covered in *shit*"".",2020-12-20 22:39:35,8,250,40,1358

The horse immediately bursts out laughing, slapping his hoof on the table.The barman shakes his head in disbelief, but honours the bet.  The man then says ""I've got to say, I didn't know if that would work, but I'm feeling lucky; how about this, if I can make him cry, I drink for free all night.

kgx1cq,0,first_name_harshit,There was a businessman whose wife was REALLY into sex.,"He was a hardworking guy but still managed to satisfy his wife's needs. One time he had to leave for another country for a business meet. He would've been gone for a week. He knew his wife's sex drive and didn't want to take risks so he thought he should gift her something so she can satisfy herself and doesn't think about searching for a new partner so he went to an adult toy shop.As soon as he entered the first thing he saw was a blow up doll but soon dismissed the thought of buying it since it's almost like another human, he then proceeded to the dildos section. There he saw all kinds of dildos, from massive to tiny to ones which glow in the dark but none of them grabbed his interest so he decided he'll go somewhere else and begins to leave the shop when he was stopped by the owner sitting behind the cash counter. ""I know what you're looking for"", the owner says This grabbed the businessman's attention and he stopped to hear what the owner had to say. ""There was a man many years ago who looked just like you, wealthy but tired. He had a wife whom he couldn't satisfy and she was about to leave him when he came here and got my help. He's happily married since then"" ""How exactly did you help him?"" Asked the businessman.The cashier bent down and revealed an engraved wooden box from under the counter. There were all sorts of symbols on the box. He opens it and inside it was a pink latex dildo, similar to the ones on the shelf. ""This is an ancient artifact haunted by a Maori tribe who all died of sex deprivation when all the women of their village were killed in a plague, all their souls now reside in this dildo"", said the owner. The businessman being a sceptical guy laughed and then turns to leave. The owner says, ""You're all the same, thinking there's nothing above this material plane of existence. Watch this."" The businessman turns around. ""Voodoo Dildo, keyhole"" To his astonishment, the businessman saw the box violently shake and the dildo rise in the air, float for a second and hover over to the keyhole in the front door and start to fuck it. The dildo fucked the keyhole with such force that the door unhinged and started cracking. ""Voodoo Dildo, box"" The dildo stops fucking the door and returns to the box. ""ILL TAKE IT"", screamed the businessman, and after a lot of negotiation he finally purchased the dildo and ran home. He tells his wife about the dildo and how to use it. ""Voodoo Dildo, pussy. That's how you activate it"", the businessman told his wife and went on his business trip. After 3 days of being horny the wife finally gave into her urges and opened the wooden box, took out the dildo and uttered ""Voodoo Dildo, pussy"". The dildo shot from her hands and started fucking her. First slowly and then changing speed as the way she wanted. After an hour of fucking, the wife thought it was enough and she grabbed the dildo. But it didn't stop fucking her. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to stop the dildo. She started panicking and called him but he didn't pick up so she started to dress up and go for the hospital, all the while the dildo still fucking her. She got in her car and started driving. On the way she had a huge orgasm and her car served and almost hit another car. A police car saw this and she was stopped at the side of the highway. A policeman approached her. ""Ma'am you almost hit the grey SUV back there, have you been drinking?"" The wife then proceeds to tell him all about her husband and the voodoo Dildo and that she can't stop it now.

kgwm4x,0,timthedriller,Two lawyers stranded on an island.,"Two lawyers had been stranded on a deserted island for several months.The only other thing on the island was a tall coconut tree, which provided their food. Each day, one of the lawyers climbed to the top of the tree to see if he could see a rescue boat coming.One day, the lawyer yelled down from the tree, ""Wow. I can't believe my eyes. There is a girl out there floating in our direction.""The lawyer on the ground was very skeptical and said, ""I think you're hallucinating and you should come down right now.""So, the lawyer reluctantly climbed down and told his friend that he had just actually seen a naked blonde woman floating face up... headed toward their island. The other lawyer started to laugh, thinking his friend had surely lost his mind. But within a few minutes, up to their beach floated a naked blonde woman, face up, and totally unconscious.The two lawyers went over to her and discovered to their amazement that she was still alive. One said to the other, ""You know, we've been on this island for months now without a woman. It's been a long time.

Again, he asked the German guards to have it dropped over his base on the next raid. The German barked at him ""Nein!""The pilot asked, ""Why not?

kgw0sp,0,S2Charlie,A man wakes up in a dingy slum,"With no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",2020-12-20 08:37:55,8,1340,30,7344

They watched a sailor go up to a shack and knock on the door. A little peephole opened and the sailor said, ""I want to have some fun."" A female voice from inside said something unintelligible, the door opened, the sailor went in and came out a little while later with a smile on his face. This was repeated several times, all the while the boys growing more and more bored. Finally, they decided they want to have some fun, too, so they mustered up their courage and went up to the shack and knocked. The peephole opened and they said, ""We want to have some fun."" A lady’s voice responded, ""That’ll cost you two dollars. Do you have two dollars?"" Each boy fished in his pockets, but they only had two nickels between them. They held up the two nickels, and the lady said, ""Well, the cost is two dollars for everything, but I’ll give you ten cents worth of fun."" The boys thought that was a good deal, so they handed over their nickels and into the shack they went. Once inside, the whore hoisted up her skirt, grabbed one boy by the hair and rubbed his face up and down on her pussy, now nasty after servicing all the sailors. Then she grabbed the second boy by the hair and did the same thing. Finally, she took both boys by the hair, led them back outside, knocked their heads together like coconuts, went back inside, and shut the door. Dazed, the first boy said to the second, ""Did you have fun?"" The second boy responded, ""Yeah. Did you have fun?"" The first boy thought for a moment, and then said, ""Yeah, I had fun. But I don’t think I could take two dollars’ worth.""",2020-12-20 06:10:24,8,317,41,1683

Clarence then tells Earl, ""let’s clip the ear off of one of the pigs so we can tell them apart and that one will be my pig"". Thinking that’s a good idea, Earl agrees and they proceed to clip the ear off of one pig. A few days later, the pigs get in to a fight and the pig with one ear bites the ear off of the other pig. Earl turns to Clarence and tells him ""since both pigs now only have one ear, how about we  now clip the remaining ear off you your pig so we can tell them apart"". Clarence agrees and they proceed to clip the other ear off of the poor pig. Well as it turns out, once pigs start fighting, of course they are going to end up fighting again. Now the pig that has both ears clipped has the upper hand or should I say snout, and proceeds to bite the remaining ear off of the other pig. Clarence and Earl are in a conundrum now, since they ran out of ears to clip off. Clarence then has an idea and tells Earl ""how ‘bout we clip the tail off of your pig Earl, seeing as they both have no ears now"". Earl agrees and they clip the tail off of the poor earless pig. Of course, the pigs end up fighting again. Now the pig without a tail proceeds to bite the tail off of the other pig. Earl and Clarence see what happened and they are dumbfounded, they have no idea how to tell them apart now, so Earl turn to Clarence and says "" will you see that! How ‘bout we just each take a pig and place them in separate pens seeing as we now can’t tell them apart and they just keep on fighting"".

kgm1p9,0,homegrowncone,Three men find a genie in the woods (FRAT Alert),"Three guys are hiking through the woods when they find an old lamp. One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I’ll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he’s holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he’s holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it’s time for their second wish. The first guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. The second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy’s wife immediately starts flirting with him. The third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. The first guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don’t bother him anymore. The second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. The third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he’s now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. The first guy is ecstatic: ""I’ve invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I’ve never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" The second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I’m still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven’t aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" The third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says: ""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",2020-12-19 19:46:28,10,480,48,2542

To my surprise, I felt a bump and heard a yelp.I get out of my car and instantly recognized my neighbor's cat — I felt terrible. Feeling it was the right thing to do, I went and grabbed my neighbor to tell her the bad news and she went absolutely ballistic. She was threatening me with a lawsuit and creating a scene in our neighborhood. After about 10 minutes of yelling, she ended up calling the cops.  The cops got there and she was insisting they charge me with anything they could. Thankfully for me, they said there wasn’t much they could do because my city won’t charge someone for inadvertently killing an animal.  At that point, my neighbor was furious and demanded she gets some sort of justice. The cops asked her what she wanted and she said ""we’ll I need at least $500"". I started to panic and really didn’t want to fork over $500 no matter how bad I felt.  I look over to the cops hoping that doesn’t have to happen and to my surprise, the cops were putting my neighbor in handcuffs. At this point, I just consider myself lucky and stopped talking while my neighbor is screaming and asking what they’re arresting her for.

The mother was a scientist, creating many experiments and potions. She was well known in the village for creating many antidotes, prescription drugs and potions. Ali’s father, on the other hand, was a world renowned chef. His cuisines were delicious and varied; some had sauces, some had ice, some had veggies and some had spice. They both had dated for a very long time and were interested in each other’s careers.One day, while Ai’s father was preparing a pasta dish, some of Ai’s mother’s potions got accidentally mixed in, and when she ate the dish, something unexpected had. The child Ai ingested the Magic concoction in the womb, so 9 months later, she was born a witch.Her parents could tell by her green shade, pointy ears, and the mole on her nose. The child Ai used her magic  telekinesis powers to grab a nearby binky, and Ai put it in her mouth. This was when  her parents knew they had to keep her secret from the public. So Ai usually spent her time inside, alone, reading books and eating her father’s meals. She was a kind hearted child, but Ai eventually got sick of staying indoors. She had planned a way to sneak out of her cottage during the night. Ai dogged a tunnel through her basement out to the backyard. It took forever, but Ai finally escaped her home.When Ai flew around in the sky, she had finally felt free. She had worn a disguise with sunglasses, a scarf and green dress. She decided to fly down to the village’s festival to see what it might be like. There were balloons, exotic fruits, cheeses and meats, music, dancing, the whole shebang. Ai’s attention was caught at a pretty little green ring that only costed 10 cents. She didn’t have any money, and she hadn’t thought of how she could get any. Suddenly, Ai’s attention was drawn away from the ring and towards a lonely boy with ripped clothes sitting on a fountain. She flew down in the distant trees and walked over to him and sat down next to him. ""What do you want?"" The boy asked with a sad tone. ""I just wanted to say hi!"" She said with a little wave and smile. ""Why would you want to say hello to ME?"" ""Because I’ve never had any friends before! By the way, my name is Ai."" ""I’m Yurt. Sorry if I came off as rude, it’s just I have a terrible secret I can’t tell anyone."" ""What is it? You can tell me anything!"" Ai said positively. ""Well; my family is poor. Everyone else here is rich, when our family can only afford one loaf of a bread a week!"" ""I’m sorry! Is there anything I can do tohelp you? ""Well... I’ve always wanted to try one of those fruit kabobs, but... the rich kids are over there. They always make fun of me for not having any money! If it isn’t too much to ask... could you take this dime and buy one for me?"" ""Of course!"" Ai said happily.So Ai got up and walked over to the table with fruit kabobs. On her way, however, she once again noticed the pretty green ring she had spotted when she was flying. And just like the fruit kabob’s, the ring was ten cents.So obviously, Ai just wasted Yurt dime.",2020-12-18 10:10:04,13,581,67,3094

kflv7u,0,tbonemistake,A Rare Dish,"This is a long one.An English cook is trying to build up his skills as a chef. He's been working for years learning all sorts of rare and unique dishes to serve at his mentor's restaurant.One day a wealthy guest at the restaurant asks to meet the cook and says ""While I enjoyed the meal good cook I must say that there is something that dissapointed me""The cook apologised and asked what the issue was""You see on my travels I had a most delightful dish cooked by a travelling chef but have been unable to find it anywhere else since. I had heard this restaurant dealt in exotic foods and thought I might at last find it on the menu. Alas it seems you do not serve it.""""What was the dish called?"" asked the cook""I believe the chef called it poy"" said the guest.The cook was perplexed, he had never heard of poy before and decided to do some research when he got home.After a few weeks the cook found nothing on the mysterious poy. He decided that since the guest had found it while travelling that he should do the same. So he asked his chef for a holiday so he could track the dish down and packed his bags.He began by getting in touch with a friend from cullinary school called Jaques that had opened a resaurant in Paris. When the cook arrived he asked Jaques if he had ever heard of poy.""Ah! Oui I 'ave indeed 'eard of zis dish, but I only know ze name. I believe it was Monsieur Gino in Italy zat mentioned it ze last time 'e was 'ere.""The cook was delighted to finally have a lead and sat down to some Jaques' famous garlic snails that evening before setting off the next day.When the cook arrived in Milan he sought out Gino's countryside restaurant that overlooked a beautiful vinyard. There spoke to the aged Italian chef that introduced himself. After a gorgeous meal and some fine wine the cook asked Gino ""My friend in France said you mentioned a dish called poy on your last visit, what do you know about it?""The Italian's eyes lit up "" Sí my friend sí! Many years ago I heard rumours of it in a Thai street market.""The two of them then sat up all night drinking bottle after bottle of wine discussing the intricacies of cuisine.The cook woke up severely hungover the next afternoon and caught a plane to Bangkok. Having recovered on the plane he wasted no time in going to street food stands around the city. He asked around, place after place but found very little of use in his search. Just as the cook was about to give up he met a traveller from India eating at one of the stands. The Indian man claimed to be from a village at the foot of the Himilayas. ""I have heard of this poy you are looking for. There are stories told in my village to this day of the wandering chef and his magnificent poy. I will bring you there.""With that, the cook ate his fill of the variety available in the market and took off with his new companion to the north of India.Upon arriving in the village the cook was greeted warmly as a guest by the family of the traveller. When the mother learnt he was a cook she grew excited, pressing him for new recipes but keeping hers close to the chest. Eventually after much back and forth the cook was able to ask about poy.""You like my cooking so I'll tell you. This good for nothing vagrant comes into my home and insults my cooking! Starts talking poy this and poy that! Eats his fill of my food then disappears into the mountains without even saying thank you! When you find him you give him a piece of my mind!""With that the cook said his thank yous and set about finding a guide for the mountains.After meeting a Sherpa that agreed to guide him, the cook took off. The trek was hard, day after day soon turned into week after week of climbing. The cook was cold and battered, wondering if it was worth it, wondering if he'd ever find this mysterious poy. He trudged on one step after another until at last a village came into sight. The guide pointed and said ""This where you find poy"". The cook was delighted, in spite of his empty stomach and worn out legs he practically ran for the village.When he arrived he immediately asked to meet the one who made poy. One of the villagers beconed him and sat him down in a small house. The cook couldn't believe it, after all this time he was finally going to get to taste poy and bring the recipe with him back to London.The chef walked in. He was small Tibetan man. He looked expectantly at the cook. The cook cleared his throat and said ""Hello sir, I would like to try this poy I've heard so much about.""The cook says in a thick west country accent ""No problem, what kind of poy would you like. Mince and gravy poy or steak and kidney poy""",2020-12-18 07:15:29,3,874,11,4629

We have brought some important visitors here too, fine examples of making America great again. Everyone, I want you to meet Steve.

But now, thanks to my beautiful tax cut, Steve gets more than twice as much dimes and quarters on a typical day. More than twice. Can you believe that?Then here is Mary. She is from Texas and because of Obama, Mary lost her job to Mexican immigrants. For the past six years, instead of working, Mary has spent her days doing nothing but drinking beer and gazing at the desert. Today, thanks to my new Southern Border Wall, which is already almost started to be scheduled for planning, Mary may soon get something new to look at. Isn't that great? And last, say hello to John. Under the Obama administration, he was a thief and a fraud, and nobody could do anything about it. The police were weak and helpless.

kfgyqx,0,kgangadhar,Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile...,"In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! ""Thank you, young men,"" said the fairy, ""Your hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?""""This is my friend Set, and you can call me ‘Ep’"", said Amenhotep.""Very well, Ep,"" said the fairy ""What is the desire of your heart?""""I wish I was the strongest man in the world!"" Amenhotep wished.""Very well"", said the fairy, ""but you must always use your strength to help others."" Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles.The fairy turned to Set ""And what is your wish, Set?""  Set responded ""I never want to be poor again! I wish for money!""""Very well,"" said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. ""Greetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!""""Elmon is an expert in all things money,"" said the fairy, ""He will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.""Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now-massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname ""Imp"". With Elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep.Ep and Set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping and became more focused on business expansion and the money of the business.As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the HQ in Cairo to learn the business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on Set’s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.Josep was shocked and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon and sent the teenager to jail.Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set’s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. ""Come, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.""Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon’s murder.The case was brought before the court, but Set’s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.Obviously, Ep’s teen didn’t kill Imp’s elf.",2020-12-18 00:58:33,7,760,37,4403

Do not speak to those who live there; you must remain silent until the moon rises tomorrow night. Go to the large room on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, face the corner, and meditate.""He did just as the Zen Master instructed. His meditation was frequently interrupted by worries. He worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to join the pipes and other trash he was sitting on. He worried how would he know when the moon rose on the next night. He worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him.His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his faith, ordure fell from the second floor onto him. At that time two people walked into the room. The first asked the second who the man was sitting there was. The second replied ""Some say he is a holy man.

kf5wh6,0,smooleybotcheck,Jews vs Christians.,"To settle the age old tensions between them Christians and Jews decide to have a winner-takes-all contest in Jerusalem. This contest will be fought between the two greatest theologians of their respective religions, and the medium used will be expressive sign language. The two parties meet in the old city, out in the open in the city centre, a huge crowd gathers around them, watching in rapt silence. A priest and a rabbi leave their respective camps and square off in the middle of the emptied street. By coin toss, which the rabbi wins, he elected to graciously allow the priest to go first. The priest begins by waving is out stretched hand across the city. The rabbi looks flustered and points to the ground. The priest, confused raises his hand and holds up three fingers. The rabbi, red faced holds up one finger in reply. The priest, sweating profusely, his collar undone and clothes soaked brings out an apple. The rabbi fumbles with his belongings and brings out a loaf of bread and wine. The priest falls to his knees weeping, and is carried away by his colleagues, wailing all the way. The rabbi stomps off back his party. In the Christian camp there is pandemonium. ""What happened out there, Father? What did he say?"" Asked an Archbishop. ""Father, the rabbi...he’s a genius, no matter what I hit him with he had a reply. I can’t fight him anymore"" The Archbishop demands to know what was said. ""At first. I began with a gesture, signifying that God, in all his majesty is everywhere. But the rabbi reminded me, that God is also present here too"" ""I then held up three fingers. Representing the holy trinity of our Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, once again the rabbi reminded me with his one upheld finger that God is one and all"" Then, I brought out an apple, the fruit of the garden of Eden, the symbol of creation itself. But the rabbi... He showed me the bread and the wine.. the body and blood of our lord Jesus Christ. I cannot beat him. He’s a genius"" There is similar confusion in the Jewish camp. ""Rabbi! Tell us what happened!"" The rabbi is furious; ""THAT BLOKES A MADMAN!!"" ""First he says to me, you Jews, piss off, and I says WERE STAYING RIGHT HERE"" ""Then he says to me, I’ll give you lot three days to clear off. So I says I give you lot one day to piss off and all!"" ""Then he starts playing mind games and shows me his snack, so I show him my lunch HES A LUNATIC!"" Disclaimer; no insult intended to anyone.

kf0c1f,0,Admiral37,On the Mass Pike,"Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 50 dead crows in and around greater Boston recently. There was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 96% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 4% were killed by an impact with a car.MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat roadkill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah!!"", not a single one could shout ""Truck.""",2020-12-17 09:14:48,4,175,16,1072

He had a daughter which meant the world to him. One day while he was on his way to work, he heard the news that his daughter fell inside a well, while she was playing. He immediately rushed to the spot and started yelling for help. No one had the courage to jump down the well and rescue her. It was a long well. He went frenzy. But one man in his mid 30s jumped in. Seeing this everyone started helping him and they managed to pull out the man and the landlord's daughter. The landlord was overwhelmed. He was so happy that he decided to express his gratitude to this man by arranging a party for the whole village, in order to celebrate this man. He even invited the nearby villages for the party. So on the day of the party, the whole village turned up. It was like a festival which was super lit, except for this man who was sad, melancholy and lost in some deep thought. The landlord said to him 'Oh my dear brother, when no one had the courage to jump into that dangerous well, you did, just to save my daughter, who means the world to me. I arranged this huge party to celebrate your brave act. But why are you upset? Do you want gold? A land? A car? A house? Spit out whatever your mind is yearning for'. That man who hadn't opened his mouth since the incident replied with a dull tone 'I don't want any gifts. I just have one doubt. Can you clarify it for me?'. The landlord was surprised. 'Oh,  I didn't expect this. Well, what is it?' the landlord asked. The man asked with curiosity, ' who pushed me into the well?'..... ..",2020-12-17 02:03:07,5,320,24,1652

keoe6p,0,confusedAbtLoveToday,The Trids and the Rabbi,"Once there was a rabbi who was a happy hermit living by himself in some hills far away from anyone else. It wasn’t that he didn’t like people, he just found that being alone was satisfying.Every day, the rabbi would walk through the woods in the hills. So familiar with the woods was he that he knew every rock, every tree, each flower, and even named the bees and the birds. It was a good life.This is why that is was such a surprise to the rabbi when one day, which happened to be his cake day, he saw a half-dozen short, stocky little creatures hiding in some undergrowth. Their eyes locked, and the creatures jumped up from their position. The rabbi was stunned by their appearance.Their skin was gray, mottled with tan splotches. Yellow eyes stared right through him from beneath the hood of their brown cloaks. Though they were short, their fingers were long and slender.They spoke excitedly to each other in high-pitch voices in a language the rabbi had never heard. They pointed vigorously in his direction, watching him intently all the while. Finally, they completed their huddle and one of the creatures stepped forward, raising a hand in greeting.""Fair day to you, human,"" said the creature. ""We are trids. No human has ever seen us before, and we aren’t sure what we should do with you, but our wise and great king will know. You will come with us.""The rabbi, not sensing that there was really any danger, agreed to go with them.So through the hills the seven went, walking for miles, farther than the rabbi usually went on his own. They came to a small cave opening. The trids motioned for him to follow them.The cave was lit with luminous rocks, and the rabbi watched them glow with wonder. The cave floors were rocky, though passable without too much difficulty. The biggest problem for the rabbi was that the ceilings were a bit low for his taste, and he bumped his head a time or two. After a short journey (perhaps a long one as far as his back was concerned), the tunnels let out into a grand hall. It may have been the most amazing sight of his life. It was so large, the rabbi wouldn’t have been surprised if the entire hill was hallowed out. In the center of this grand hall was a circular, raised platform of carefully carved stones, perhaps 40’ tall. A double helix of a staircase and what appeared to be a slide of some kind encircled the platform. On top was a large throne, where a much larger trid sat comfortably, his back to the rabbi. A long line of trids led up to the king. His traveling companions got in line, and the rabbi followed protocol.After being in line for some time, the rabbi finally figured out what was happening. The trids were taking the staircase up to see the king. After a bow and a brief exchange of words, the trids would turn around, bend over, and with a swift, hard kick, the king would send them tumbling down the slide. The rabbi thought this quite strange, but didn’t want to embarrass his companions or make a scene.Eventually, it was the rabbi’s turn. He looked at the king, bowed, offered what he hoped was a polite greeting, and then turned around and bent over, ready for the kick. Instead of kicking him, the king tapped him on the shoulder and said, ""silly rabbi, kicks are for trids!""",2020-12-16 19:38:39,5,591,23,3254

In order to do this the zebra decides to hold a competition in which animals will have to compete in front of a judge. Whoever the first one to makemake the judge laugh wins and will perform for the lion.So the first thing the zebra does is look for the most serious animal. He walks up to a tortoise and asks, ""Hey tortoise, I’m holding a competition and all you have to do is sit there and laugh if you find an animal to be funny. Will you do it?""  The tortoise responds, ""...Yes.""The day of the competition arrives and all The animals have gathered to compete. Since this is for the lion, the zebra decides to raise the stakes to ensure every animal delivers their full potential. He says, ""Animals, your goal is to make the tortoise laugh. If you are able to do so, you win and get to perform for the lion. If you fail to make the tortoise laugh, then you will be killed and become the lion’s meal.""The competition begins and up first is the monkey. He jumps from tree to tree, does flips, and makes funny noises. The zebra becomes pleased and looks at the tortoise and asks what he thinks, to which the tortoise says, ""..."" Since there is no reaction from the judge, the monkey is killed.Up next is the ostrich. He runs around in circles and is moving his long neck. He jumps and does funny moves. The zebra is once again pleased and turns to see the reaction of the tortoise, which once again is, ""..."" So there’s nothing the zebra can do and they have the ostrich killed.This pattern goes on with many of the funniest animals and the zebra becomes worried that they won’t have someone for the lion’s party. All of a sudden the next animal approaches, the hippopotamus. The zebra knows that he won’t be able to perform any fun tricks and just as he’s about to have him killed, he hears a chuckle from the tortoise. That chuckle turns into full blown roars of laughter. The zebra is bewildered and asks the tortoise, ""Hey what’s so funny? He hasn’t done anything! He is literally just standing there!""

The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel - it was great! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!""

I am afraid that I will pick something obvious that someone else will also wish for, and then my wish will not come true.""Ryan tells him that he should wish for something extremely specific. He tells Johnny that he is going to wish for $57,643,974,524.58 because he knows that no one else would wish for that exact amount.Johnny calms down, and they continue to get closer to the front of the line. When it is Ryan‘s turn, he enters his wish and walks away from the wishing station. A minute later, Johnny catches up to him.Ryan asks him what he ended up wishing for.

The waiting time is now estimated at between fifteen minutes and eternity. In order to expedite your call, please punch your 63-digit product identification number onto your telephone touch pad, followed by your product serial number, which can be found in a secret compartment inside your computer where, for security purposes, it is printed in the smallest typeface known to mankind. Do that now.(Lengthy excerpt from Mahler's ""Lugubrious"" Symphony in C Minor)Thank you again for calling Technical Support. We recommend that you sit at your computer, preferably turning it on at some point, and have at hand all your floppy disks, CD-ROM disks, computer manuals and original packing materials in order to allow the technician to aid you in the unlikely event that he ever takes your call. It would also be helpful for you to refrain from sobbing while explaining your problem to the technician. Shouting obscene threats will cause you to be immediately disconnected and blackballed from further communication with Technical Support, not only from ours but that of every other electronics-related firm in the industrialized world.(Medley of Hootie and the Blowfish hits rendered by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir)Thank you once again for calling Technical Support.

If you are not sure, using the letters on your touchpad, spell out the phrase: ""I am confused and despondent and quickly losing the will to live.""

Before talking to the technician about your problem and risking the possibility that you may be wasting his valuable time, please ask yourself the following questions: If my monitor screen is dark, is it possible I have forgotten to plug in my computer or, alternately, that I have been suddenly struck blind? Have I exhausted every possible means of help before utilizing the sacred, last-resort-only telephone option? Have I sent a fax to Fast Fax Technical Support? Have I consulted my manual? Have I read the Read-Me notice on the floppy disk? Have I called up my know-it-all geek cousin who I can't stand but who can probably fix this thing for me in under five minutes? Have I given the central processing unit of my computer a good, solid whack? If you can not honestly answer ""yes"" to all these questions, please get off the line immediately so that our overworked technicians can help those truly desperate customers whose suffering is so much greater than yours.(Recording of Tibetan monks performing a six-day chant celebrating the reincarnation of one of their recently deceased colleagues into the form of a salamander.)Thank you for calling Technical Support.

kd6uee,0,Jinno69,Four rings,"So, a man wakes up in a dingy slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line.

I know a parent-trap when I see one, so I said:""Well, it depends on how you spell it.  If you spell it one way, it can mean the bottom of your foot, or a type of fish.  But if you spell it another way, it's what people call the bit of you that some people think lives for ever.""He took all of this in and looked like there was some important issue still nagging at him.  I could tell there was more to come and I waited patiently, as we walked along, with all the wisdom of the grown-up that I could muster.And sure enough, eventually, he opened his mouth to ask the question that was really eating at him:""So, Daddy,' he said, ""what's an ar-soul?"".......This was almost thirteen years ago and I'm still laughing.",2020-12-14 12:55:39,11,267,57,1380

However, his mother decided that this was no reason for him to not live a normal life, and so decided he should try taking the bus to school on his own. ""It's very simple,"" she assured her nervous boy. ""When you board the bus tomorrow morning, tell the conductor, 'Sir, I want to go to Maple Avenue.'""So the next day, little Timmy boarded the bus and said to the conductor, ""S-s-s-sir, I want t-t-t-to go to Map-p-p-le Avenue."" To his astonishment, the conductor clipped his ear before signalling the driver to move off. The day after that, he thought he'd try again. When the bus arrived, he said to the conductor, ""Sir, t-t-t-t-take me to Map-p-p-,"" and the conductor clipped his ear again. When it happened yet again, Timmy told his mother about it, and she decided to have it out with the conductor. Accordingly, the next day, the bus arrived and there was the same person. Timmy's mother angrily marched up onto the bus and demanded of the conductor, ""Why do you keep hitting my son?"" The conductor flushed with anger, pointed at Timmy and retorted, ""B-b-b-brat k-k-keeps mock-k-k-king me!""",2020-12-13 20:41:31,13,197,67,1130

Come on in.""So the comedian enters heaven and walks around. It's all that he heard about and more: angels, harps, fluffy clouds, an open bar, the works. But the angels and seraphim and the whole lot realize that the comedian walks with a downcast, humorless look. After some time, God gets word of the comedian's apparent misery and goes to him. God says,""What's troubling you, my son?""""Oh, I don't know. In life I devoted myself to laughter, to jokes. Seems like I just don't have the heart for it anymore.""""Is that all? No worries, my son, I know all the greatest jokes in Creation."" And so God tells the comedian one joke after the other--clean jokes, dirty jokes, surreal jokes, skits, bits, and everything else. All throughout, the comedian just nods, unable to do more than politely smile. Eventually God, frustrated that he cannot make this man laugh, says, ""Well, why don't you tell me one?""So the Jewish man tells a joke only he and others who have experienced the concentration camps would know. Now it is God who cannot laugh, but only smiles with tremendous sadness in His eyes. The comedian shrugs and says,""Eh, I guess you had to have been there.""",2020-12-13 18:57:46,5,250,25,1419

So, before a long trip, the husband wanted to get his wife something special to help the 'lonliness' while he was away. He went to his local sex shop, and talked to the person behind the counter. He explained his situation, and then asked: ""I need something really amazing for my wife. All I see here are normal toys. Do you have anything in the back that will REALLY knock her socks off?""""Well sir, there's the voodoo dick, but I don't want to sell you THAT. It's too powerful"" replied the clerk.""Please! That sounds exactly like what my wife needs!"" said the man.The salesclerk took him into a room and pulled out a box. They opened it, and inside was something that looked like a normal dildo.""That doesn't look like anything special... what does it do?"" He asked.The clerk gave the man a wink. ""Check this out. Voodoo dick, THE DOOR."" The toy jumped out of the box and began to thrust itself against the door.""Voodoo Dick, THE CEILING!"" the clerk shouted. Like magic, the dildo shot towards the ceiling and began pumping away.""I'll take it!"" The man was so happy. The clerk put the toy back in the box and wrapped it up. So the man took the Voodoo Dick back home to his wife and showed her how to use it. Then, he left for his next trip.The wife, with her husband away, took out the voodoo dick and said ""voodoo dick... my pussy!"" It was the best toy she had ever had. She kept at it for hours. Finally, she wanted it to stop. Unfortunately, every time she pulled it out, it just lept back in and started again. She decided to go to the sex shop to see if the clerk could tell her how to turn if off.While she was driving, the Voodoo Dick started making her come. Her arms and legs were shaky, so she started swerving, and a cop pulled her over.When the cop came to her window, she was frantic.

You had two hours to create any dish, as long as it is as indicative of a country's culture as possible. All four of them had thought long beforehand, and were ready to take on the challenge.Soon, food was simmering, rice was boiling and pots and pans were clattering. The judges were eager to try their food, after all they've literally made it to the finals.After two hours of intense cookery, the chefs were ready. Their food plated, and put on a table for the judges to test.Starting off, Jack made a plate of pasta. The sauce was warm and inviting, and it's aroma filling the air. Judge #1 took a single bite, and said, ""This Italian food is absolutely perfect! The pasta is cooked without fail, and it tastes far better than anything else I've ever had! 10/10!""Then, the judges went to Jill's dish. On it, was an enormous steak. It sizzled with heat and was spicy and juicy. Judge #2 looked at it, and proudly announced, ""Large portion size, meat... this is clearly American food! Don't mind if I take a bite!"" He put a slice of steak in his mouth, and his eyes lit up. ""Oh my word, this is absolutely heavenly! Top notch cooking, Jill! You've exceeded my expectations! 10/10!""Afterwards, it was Mike's turn. He presented eight steamed buns, resting inside of a bamboo casing. A puff of steam greeted the judges when the lid was raised. Judge #3 piped up. ""Clearly this is Chinese food! I'd love to have a taste of my homeland!"" With that, he picked one up and shoved it in his mouth. ""厲害！ (Amazing!) This is the best I've ever had (sorry mom)! The prawns and the bun is so good, I want to eat all of it! 10/10!""Finally, it was Rob's turn. Everyone knew that Rob was the most creative, and was always pleasing the judges. So it must have been surprised when he took the lid off his plate and revealed...Nothing. Not a single grain of rice, or a single vegetable or a single cube of meat. It was completely empty.Before the judges could utter a word, Rob said, ""Hey judges. I've made African food.""&amp; (Sorry)",2020-12-13 18:02:36,14,372,84,2049

kcc4hr,0,plasticrockingchair,So an english woman and a black woman got into a fight at a Victoria's Secret,"Officer Riley was used to being tasked to cases like these. In fact, he got assigned to these cases so much that he had gotten pretty good at resolving these situations in a way where everyone left happy, but Riley found these cases really boring. Still, he finished his doughnut, took a sip of his coffee, and began to make his way to the store.He got to the store pretty quickly. The cop cars outside let him know he was in the right place. As he pulled up, he made eye contact with Officer Patrick, and he promptly got out of his car to meet him. After a quick greeting Patrick began to explain the situation. ""An english woman and a black woman got into a fight but the women involved are either too distraught or angry to talk to us,"" Officer Patrick explained. He didn't need to say anything more. Riley looked towards the entrance of the Victoria's Secret and immediately saw the two ladies in question. One of them was sitting on the sidewalk holding her head, and a few feet away from her was the other woman still very clearly upset.Riley decided that the woman on the sidewalk needed his help first as he was confident she lost the fight. He approached her and introduced himself and told her that he needed to know what happened. After some poking and proding she finally began to talk. ""I was just talking on the phone and that lady over just came up to me and started screaming at the top of her lungs,"" the english woman said. ""Surely there was more to it than that,"" Riley said, ""Can you recall saying anything on the phone that may have set her off?"" She swore up and down that she was just having a regular conversation with a friend, and she didn't say anything that could've offended anyone.Now that he got one side of the story it was time to talk to the other woman. Riley made his way past the officers trying to calm her down, and introduced himself as he did with the english woman. Luckily the other officers seemed to have calmed down a bit since he got there. She admitted to beating up the other woman with just a single ask, but now he needed to know why. ""Why'd you do it?"" Riley asked.""That bitch is racist!"" the black woman said.

kc6zkg,0,ZevVeli,The gloopmaker (long joke is long),"A man finishes high school and has no idea what he wants to do with his life. After sitting on the couch for about a year he suddenly decides that he wants to be a chef. So he searches and finds a few restaurants that are looking for chefs. He goes to the first restaurant and walks up to the owner. ""I hear that you need chefs, I'd like to be a chef."" The owner says ""Great! Do you have any experience?"" The man shakes his head ""No, but I'm willing to learn!"" The owner frowns. ""I'm sorry but I'm only looking for experienced chefs, I'm afraid I can't hire you."" Undeterred thr man goes to the next restaurant on his list. ""I hear that you need chefs, I'd like to be a chef."" He says again. Once more the owner replies ""Great! Do you have any experience?"" The man shakes his head, a little exasperated. ""No, but I'm willing to learn!"" The owner smiles politely. ""I'm sorry but I'm only looking for experienced chefs, I'm afraid I can't hire you."" The man walks off and goes to the next restaurant on his list, determined to get the job this time. ""I hear that you're hiring chefs, I'd like to be a chef."" The owner looks at him. ""Great! Do you have any experience."" The man sighs ""No, but I am willing to learn."" The owner shakes his head. ""I'm sorry but I'm only looking for experienced chefs, I'm afraid I can't hire you."" The man jumps up exasperated. ""This is ridiculous! No one is willing to hire a chef with no experience! But how am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me?"" The restaurant owner nods his head. ""I understand your frustration"" he says, in a voice cultivated by years of customer service and placating entitled and angry diners, ""you know, if you join the military they'll train you in a skill, you might be able to become a chef that way."" The man stops. ""That...might work. Thank you!""So the man goes down to the Naval recruitment center and marches up to the recruiter. ""I want to join the Navy!"" He says. ""GREAT!"" Says the recruiter. ""Do you have any skills?""""No, but I want to learn to be a chef!""""The navy doesn't really need chefs,"" the recruiter explains with a bit of resentment of the truth of the statement in his tone, ""but we always need more Sailors, do you want to be a sailor?""""I don't want to be a sailor I want to be a chef!"" And he storms out, next he goes to the Air Force recruitment center and marches up to the recruiter. ""I want to join the Air Force!"" He says.""GREAT!"" Says the recruiter. ""Do you have any skills?""""No, but I want to learn to be a chef!""""The Air Force doesn't really need any more chefs,"" he explains, ""but we always need more pilots, do you want to be a pilot?""""I don't want to be a pilot I want to be a chef!"" And he storms out and goes to the marine recruitment center.""I want to join the marines!"" He says.""OF F*****G COURSE YOU DO SEMPER FI!"" The recruiter shouts with all the enthusiasm of a Labrador retriever that has just encountered a stranger, ""YOU GOT ANY NEW SKILLS TO BRING TO THE MARINES?""""Well, no...but I want to learn to be a chef?""""WHY THE F**K WOULD YOU WANT TO BE A CHEF? THIS IS THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS WE HAVE NO F*****G NEED FOR G*****N CHEFS! YOU CAME HERE TO BE A MARINE AND YOU'RE GONNA BE THE BEST G*****N MARINE YOU CAN BE!""""I don't want to be a marine I want..."" and is promptly thrown out of the recruitment office. So he goes down to the Army recruitment center. As he's walking through the doors he realizes that if he says he has no skills then he's not going to get into where he wants. He walks up to the recruiter.""I'd like to join the Army!"" He says.""Great!"" Says the recruiter, ""Do you have any skills?""""Yes!"" He lies. ""I'm a gloopmaker!""""I'm sorry you're a what?""""I'm a gloopmaker.""The recruiter pauses, ""What's a gloopmaker?""""A gloopmaker? It's someone who makes gloops!""""No, I get that, I mean, what's a gloop?""The man just laughs, ""hahaha, what's a gloop? Good one!""The recruiter pauses ""Okay...uh I don't think we need a gloopmaker is there anything you want to do?""""Well I've always wanted to be a chef.""""Okay! We can do that just go aheadand sign here. So the man goes off to basic, and is then sent to the culinary division to peel potatoes and learn to be a chef. Meanwhile off in the dark bowels of the Pentagon some desk jockey is manually copying over enlistment papers in triplicate because the government has to justify making all those little blue pens that say ""This pen property of the Federal Government"" and filing them when he comes across our man's form with the words ""Occupation: Gloopmaker"" written on it. He stares for a bit then turns to his supervisor.""Sir, what's a gloopmaker?""""A gloopmaker? What the hell kind of question is that! Obviously it's someone who makes gloops!""""No sir, I figured that. I mean, what's a gloop?""""Well a gloop is a...a gloop is...a gloop...why do you need to know?""""Well I've got this guy in the Army who listed his occupation as 'gloopmaker' and I'm trying to figure out what a gloop is so I know if we really need him in Culinary.""""Look! I have better things to do than explain what a gloop is to you! Go requisition a gloop! Then you'll know what one is!""""Yes sir!"" And the desk jockey runs off to supply. He gets there and calls over the Quartermaster.""I need to requisition a gloop.""The Quartermaster looks at him in confusion. ""I'm sorry?""""I need to requisition a gloop.""""What's the item number?""""I don't know.""""Check the catalogue and give me the number."" So the desk jockey flips through the catalogue 5 times but cannot find a gloop. ""I can't find it!""""What do you mean you can't find it?""""I mean I can't find any gloops in the catalogue!""""LET ME SEE THAT!"" And the quartermaster snatches the catalogue out of the desk jockey's hands and begins flipping through it.""Looks like we don't have any...why does personell need a gloop anyways?""""Well we have a gloopmaker in the Army and I didn't know what a gloop was so...""""Wait wait wait!"" The quartermaster interrupts. ""We have a gloopmaker but we don't have any gloops? This is ridiculous! I gotta take this up with my XO give me his personnel file!"" So the quartermaster goes off to his Executive Officer's office and requests permission to enter.""Sir we have an issue.""""What's wrong.""""Sir we have a gloopmaker in the army but we don't have any gloops.""""We don't have any what?""""Gloops sir. We don't have any gloops.""""But we have a gloopmaker?""""Yes sir here's his file.""The XO sighs ""I need to take this up with the General of the Army."" So the XO goes off to the 5 star general of the army.""Sir we have a problem.""""What's the problem?""""We're out of gloops.""""I'm sorry?""""We're out of gloops. We have a gloopmaker but for some reason he's in Culinary.""""What IDIOT put a gloopmaker in Culinary when we don't have any gloops? I need to take this up with the President!""So the general goes off to the white house and goes to the Oval Office.""Mr. President we have a problem, it's a matter of national security.""The president looks up at the General. ""What's the problem General.""""Mr. President I'm afraid we have no gloops.""""What do you mean we have no gloops? We are the finest army in the world the Strongest Nation on Earth! How are we supposed to protect and defend American Freedoms without any gloops?""""Don't worry Mr. President I have a solution I have a gloopmaker.""""We have a gloopmaker but no gloops? Fix this now and GET ME MY GLOOPS!""""Yes sir Mr. President!""Meanwhile back at an army base our poor guy is sitting in the kitchen peeling potatoes blissfully unaware of what is about to happen when the kitchen goes silent, he looks up and notices everyone at attention because the 5 star general just walked in.""I understand you're a gloopmaker?"" The general asks him.""Uh...yes sir...""""Good. The president needs you to make a gloop.""The guy is now thinking ""Oh shit! They're going to figure out I lied! I'm gonna get thrown out of the military and court marshalled and thrown in Federal prison for committing purjury!"" But he quickly composes himself.""Well sir, it requires some very specialized and expensive materials""The general shakes his head. ""Money is no issue. Time is no issue. You tell me what you need and we'll get it."" The man just blurts out ""I need moon rocks! At least a Ton! From the Dark Side of the Moon!""So several Million dollare later NASA sends another rocket to the moon, collects a bunch of moon rocks and brings them back to Earth. The General returns to the Army base.""Specialist Smith!"" The General yells out.""Erm, I'm a Private sir.""""Not anymore, you've been promoted. We have your moon rocks. Can you make us our gloop?""""Not yet sir! I need Heavy water! At least 50 gallons of it! From the bottom of the Marianas trench!"" Meanwhile he's thinking ""they HAVE to say no, this is too ridiculous. It's impossible!"" The General of the Army just smiles.""Money is no issue time is no issue. We'll get you your heavy water.""So several billion dollars later NOAA makes a rover that goes down to the bottom of the Marianas trench, sucks up the water, filters out the water with no Deuterium and successfully gathers up the water. The General goes back to the Army base.""Sergeant Smith!""""I'm a specialist sir!""""Not anymore, you've been promoted! We have your heavy water. Can you make us our gloop?""""Not yet sir, I need one more thing. A diamond! Clear! Flawless! Cut! At least 4000 carats!"" At this point he's thinking ""This HAS to get them to stop it! This is impossible, it doesn't exist!"" The general nods solemnly. ""Money is no issue, time is no issue. We'll get you your diamond.""So the US goes to war with South Africa on flimsy pretenses. Trillions of dollars are spent, hundreds of thousands of lives are lost, but eventually, someohow they find the diamond. The General of the Army returns to our man.""Sergeant Major Smith!""""It's just Sergeant Smith sir!""""Not anymore, you've been promoted. We have your diamond. Now make us our gloop!""So the gloopmaker is taken to a top secret military base in an undisclosed location somewhere in New Mexico (About 6 miles outside of San Mateo, just get off I 40 at exit 72 and follow route 606, Ask for Gerry at the Stop-n-shop he can give you more detailed directions) where he's locked up with some scientists. For three weeks there's a lot of banging and scraping before our man comes out ""Tell the President we have our gloop!""Five days later on an Aircraft Carrier in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean there is our man on with the President, the Joint Chief of Staff, Congress, and more brass than a firing range the last week before recertification exams. He salutes the President then turns and pulls a sheet off a large object revealing a five foot by five foot by five foot hollow metal cube with a hole in the top. A crane picks up the cube, swings it out over the edge of the ship and drops it into the water where it slowly sinks, air bubbling out of it.GLOOP!GLOOP!GLOOP!GLOOP!GLOOP!Silence reigns on the vessel for 15 seconds before the President speaks.""I want 10 more!""",2020-12-13 01:11:15,6,1958,34,10990

Normally, he would drive right by, but today he was pretty early so he figured he would offer her some assistance. So he pulls over, asks if she needs help, and he ends up jump starting her car. Afterwards, she’s so thankful that she invites him over for lunch. Normally, he would say no, but he was so early to the range and she was so persistent, he eventually said yes. So he gets to her house and she serves up a delicious lunch with margaritas. Dave tries to say no to drinking, but she was so nice and so persistent that he eventually agreed. After 3 or so margaritas, Dave blacks out and the next thing he knows, he’s waking up in this random woman’s bed. ""Oh my god! I can’t believe this happened! I’m a happily married man!"" Dave exclaimed ""I’m just going to have to come clean to my wife""So Dave drives back, gets home, and immediately goes up to his wife. ""Honey, i need to tell you something!""

You see, he'd been delivering letters for 50 years-and yet, half the time, the original packages and letters would never arrive. Instead, they'd be replaced with exact duplicates, but for the presence of the mail man's name in place of the recipients.One day, one guy (a detective) gets it in his head to follow the mailman home-he dissapears every afternoon, and nobody knows where he's going. So, the guy straps his hiking boots on and follows.First, the mailman stops by the post office to drop off his cap and his uniform. When he steps out, he's still got clothes on-a dark hood on in broad daylight, covering up something else underneath. Then he starts walking, and the detective follows.First the guy he's following encounters a lake. The detective thinks, woah, huh, a false trail. But no, because the mailman just starts walking across it.Guy thinks what the heck, rents a boat, and follows him. Now he finds on the opposite side of the lake a forest, and there's a tiny, *tiny* winding path through.He follows the path, and eventually he reaches a mountain. This mountain is taller than the UK is wide, but the detective sees the dark-cloaked postman already half way up. So, he follows him up the mountain.Six hours after this, and he *finally* reaches the top. He stretched his hand over, hauling up-and he sees a monastery. There are hundreds of monks waiting for him, each and every one smiling and bowed low in his direction.So, he gets up, and walks over to the guy he recognises-it's the mailman!He asks the mailman what's up, and why he keeps doing all this when he's a monk, and aren't monks supposed to do good, and all that, and the monk gives him the answer.""You see, my friend, the best karma?

It also demagnetizes the strips on all your credit cards, reprograms your ATM access code, screws up the tracking on your VCR and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any CDs you try to play. It will recalibrate your refrigerator’s coolness settings so all your ice cream melts and your milk curdles. It will give your ex-boy/girlfriend your new phone number. This virus will mix antifreeze in your fish tank. It will drink all your soda and leave dirty socks on the coffee table when you are expecting company. It will hide your car keys when you are late for work and interfere with your car radio reception so that you hear only static while stuck in traffic. When executed, ""Badtimes"" will also give you nightmares about circus midgets. It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine. It will give you Dutch Elm disease and brown patch. If the ""Badtimes"" message is opened in a Windows95 environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to a full bathtub. It will not only remove the forbidden tags from your mattresses and pillows, but it will also refill your skim milk with whole milk. It is insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to behold. It is also a rather interesting shade of mauve. These are just a few signs. Be afraid. Be very, very afraid.",2020-12-12 17:30:29,5,284,32,1613

To change things up, Mr. Thompkins gets an idea: Have sex in a near-by graveyard. With a mix of reluctance and excitement, Mrs. Thompkins agrees and they go off to make love in front of a--formerly--live audience. The pair find a flat tombstone to lay down upon and begin kissing, rubbing, thrusting. The sex is incredible; their faint spark ignites into a supernova.Perhaps going a little too hard, Mrs. Thompkins gets a really bad pain in her hip, after they finish. Next day, in the early afternoon, she goes to a doctor to make sure there isn't a serious sprain.  Her physical and body inspection are done, and she patiently waits to receive the results.Before too long, the doctor returns to her with a bewildered expression on his face.   ""Well, Mrs. Thompkins"",  he says, ""there is no fracture or sprain, just a simple over-extension of the muscle tissue; take things slow when you move and it'll straighten out in a few days.""Oh, thank goodness"", she says, hand covering her heart in relief. ""And thank YOU, doctor!""The doctor's forehead creases. ""Ma'am, may I ask you one, somewhat unrelated, question? A slightly strange question?""Mrs. Thompkins, now befuddled herself, answers ""Sure. Go ahead.""""Exactly how old are you?""""I'm 38. Doesn't it say that on my file?

It's Christmas Eve, he's hundreds of miles from home and the conditions are deteriorating, so he pulls into a diner parking lot, figuring some food and coffee wouldn't hurt him while he waits out the storm a bit.Predictably, the place is empty, so Krusty has his choice of tables. He picks a booth by the window, so he can keep an eye on the worsening conditions. The waitress is festively decked out in a jingle-bell necklace, reindeer-antler headband, and ornament earrings, with a name tag that reads: Dolores. ""What can I get for ya, hon?"" Dolores asks.""I'll have a cup of coffee, and how are the Eggs Benedict?""Dolores assures him they're fantastic, and says the cook makes everything in-house, so Krusty puts in his order. He's starting to feel a little less sorry for himself, even though the storm shows no sign of letting up. The food comes out pretty darn quick (hardly surprising since he's the only customer in the place). As Dolores comes over with the tray, he notices something strange: The food looks fantastic, but his whole meal is resting on something shiny. As she gets closer, he sees it's a hubcap. ""I'm sorry to ask, but why are my eggs on that hubcap?""Dolores smiles knowingly, ""Well, it's like they say in that song.

Keep boiling it and add some sugar and as the water boils off it becomes like a sticky substance that you can dip your flower bulbs in before you plant them. The flowers that result are normally twice as big as normal. It is a well know fact in Netherlands that you get wonderful tulips from Hamster Jam.,2020-12-12 04:22:28,3,118,12,602

kb6ky4,0,Glynnc,The holy grail of doughnuts.,"This is a true story, and one that I often tell people. Not sure if this format works on this subreddit, but I’m going to give it a shot anyway. Hope you guys enjoy it.One day I finally broke down and decided to give a local doughnut shop a visit. This shop was unlike any other donut shop I had ever heard of, as it specializes in gourmet doughnuts. I wasn’t quite sure what that meant, but I was willing to give it a shot.I walk in, and I am the only customer there. It is just me, and the clerk, separated by a very well lit display case filled with very, very large doughnuts, being shown off like fine jewelry. Overwhelmed by the wide selection of gourmet doughnuts, I finally say to the clerk ""I’ve never been here before... what would you suggest be my first doughnut here?"" He points to the last display case, which had only a single doughnut. Covered in sugar and cinnamon, drizzled with caramel, sitting on an elevated platter that was lined with what appeared to be diamonds.""We call that one the Jesus doughnut."" Says the clerk. I raised a brow and looked back to him and said ""Jesus doughnut? That’s a pretty big name to give a doughnut.""He smirks and says ""everyone says that before they try it. Have you ever had Horchata before? It’s basically an horchata flavored doughnut."" Me being Mexican American, I’ve probably drank more horchata than water. For those that don’t know, the easiest way to explain it is very sweet cinnamon flavored milk.I really like horchata, so I nod my head and tell him I would like one of the Jesus doughnuts. He walks over to the register and asks ""do you want that as a doughnut, or a milkshake? We basically can put all of the doughnut ingredients into a milkshake instead to make it taste like the doughnut."" I’m very, VERY, lactose intolerant, mind you, every memory of gut wrenching, toe curling bubble gut went out the window when I imagined the idea of an *horchata milkshake*. ""I’ll take the Jesus milkshake, please.""When our transaction was finished, I went out to my car, and finished this huge 44oz milkshake in one sitting before I even left the parking lot. 30 minutes later, I’m at home, and I feel my stomach drop thirty feet down. The realization of the disaster that I caused finally arrived, and I rushed to the bathroom. I’m not a very religious person, but as I sat on the toilet feeling like my insides were turning to mush and blasting out of me, I knew what I was feeling. I still tell my children that that day I felt the Holy Spirit pass straight through me, and I understood them, why they call it the Jesus doughnut.",2020-12-11 10:00:01,5,474,28,2588

kaymcv,0,jellyGATO,Three diplomats of Russia extend a visit to a city in Vietnam.,"The diplomats of Russia extend a visit to a city in Vietnam.During their stay, the Russians have a chance to wander around the city and witness everything that is going in the city, both cultural significance and less-than-desired aspects.The night before their return, they are invited to the royal banquet. After many drinks, they open up to the Vietnamese Minister of Defense: ""In Russian, no-one dares piss on streets. Our police very strict, they patrol streets day and night. If they see anyone do it, they shoot. We don’t have piss on streets problem no more. Our streets stay clean &amp; fresh.""Also intoxicated, the Minister says: ""Wonderful idea! We have try de everything from education, punishment, public shaming… but nothing de work. Street pissing serious problem here.""The Russians suggest: ""How about you let us try our method tonight and see if that solves your problem. We already got our guns.""The Minister thinks this is but a joke, he laughs and says: ""Do what you want, my good friends. I hope you scare de shit out of de street pisser.""Thus, the Russians leave the banquet armed with their guns in the middle of the night. They circle the streets of the city, shooting everyone they see pissing on the streets, walls, trees, sideways, etc. Then they return to Russia.In the morning, the news shakes the whole country of Vietnam. 69 Vietnamese shot dead in the nights, all caught in the act of public urination. It is called an act of terrorism and the Minister of Defense has to answer. After many arduous cabinet meetings, he hurries to the airport with his assistants to get to Russia to confront the Russian diplomats for their heinous deeds.When they finally meet, the Russians assert: ""You told us it was okay to use our method. So we did. You no have smaller street pissing problem, da?""Fuming in anger, the Minister yells: ""I thought it was joke. How dare you do such ting and kill our people?""Russians say: ""What do you suggest we do to be even?""The Vietnamese suggest: ""We will do to your citizens what you did to ours. We take our guns, patrol your city tonight, and shoot everyone we see pissing publicly. EVERYONE!""""Deal!"", agree the Russians. ""We have used the method long time. Our people are scared straight, no-one dares piss on streets.""Before long, the Vietnamese take leave with their guns. They circle the city three times, visiting &amp; stopping at many streets to see no-one publicly urinate. Frustrated, they almost give up until they see two people pissing on a wall in a dark path. Thinking it is now their chance to exact vengeance, they empty the guns at the two people. After having committed the shooting, they feel proud and return to the hotel.The next morning, the news shakes the whole country of Russian. The shooting has been called an act of hate crime resulting in the two deaths of two Vietnamese students studying abroad in Russia.",2020-12-11 01:01:54,12,496,62,2895

Thinking he had done enough he turns around to find the man smiling. Even more angry he returns to his truck and gets a baseball bat out and smashes all the windows and lights. When he looks again the man is giggling. Starting to rage now, the trucker drops the bat and slashes all his tyres to which the man bursts out laughing. Well, the trucker finally loses it, gets a can of gasoline from the truck, pours it all over the brand new sports car and sets it on fire. When he turns around to see man's reaction, he is nearly falling over with fits of laughter. Mystified, the trucker asks "" what the hell is so funny ???"" The man replies, "" while you weren't looking, i stepped out of the circle four times !!""",2020-12-10 20:34:31,22,266,103,1341

He immediately apologises and tells her he knows not what came over him. She is cool, explaining that she knows the way of the modern world and forgives him adding that she is married to Jesus. She rings the bell and leaves the bus at her stop.The man later goes down stairs at his stop but the bus driver tells him that he saw him in his mirror and read his lips so knows what he said to the nun. The man is devastated but the driver says he couldn’t care less as he fancies her too. He tells him that the nun takes this bus to her nunnery every week at that time,10pm., on that day and if he was to hang about in the dark wooded area she has to pass through to her nunnery, well, he could have his wicked way with her.The next week the man is there in the dark woodland and as the nun appears he jumps out before her but he is dressed in a long brown robe, sandals, false long beard, crown of thorns and says, ‘sister, behold it is I, Jesus and I come to make love to you as you husband’. She throws herself at his feet and wails that she is so sorry but it is her time of the month and he sighs, wishes her well and says he should leave. ‘No, no my lord, I cannot miss this holy congress with you so you could put it in another place, if you wish’, she pleads. He agrees, she bends over a large tree stump and the act takes place after which the man breaks down crying and screaming for forgiveness telling the nun that he is really the man on the bus from last week. He pulls his beard off, throws his crown of thorns to the ground and begs her generosity and pity. She walks closer to him, bends to lift his head gently with her hand and pulling at her head covering says, ‘not a problem, I’m the bus driver.'",2020-12-10 19:56:00,13,366,58,1816
